<BBE> And Jehovah saith unto Gideon, `By the three hundred men who are lapping I save you, and have given Midian into thy hand, and all the people go, each to his place.'
<BBE> for we have known Him who is saying, `Vengeance  Mine, I will recompense, saith the Lord;' and again, `The Lord shall judge His people;' --

<BBE> in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,
