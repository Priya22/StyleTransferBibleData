<BBE> There is nothing in the ark, only the two tables of stone which Moses put there in Horeb, when Jehovah covenanted with the sons of Israel in their going out of the land of Egypt.
<BBE> And I have laid a charge on every one Who is leaping over the threshold in that day, Who are filling the house of their masters  violence and deceit.
<BBE> And on the morrow, they having come forth from Bethany, he hungered,
<BBE> and they, having heard that he is alive, and was seen by her, did not believe.
<BBE> having run about through all that region round about, they began upon the couches to carry about those ill, where they were hearing that he is,
<BBE> and having entered into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right hand, arrayed in a long white robe, and they were amazed.
<BBE> `But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
<BBE> `A voice of one calling in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight make ye his paths,' --
<BBE> and having heard, they were glad, and promised to give him money, and he was seeking how, conveniently, he might deliver him up.
<BBE> and Jesus answering said to them, `Give back the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;' and they did wonder at him.
<BBE> but now put off, even ye, the whole -- anger, wrath, malice, evil-speaking, filthy talking -- out of your mouth.
<BBE> And as he is going forth into the way, one having run and having kneeled to him, was questioning him, `Good teacher, what may I do, that life age-during I may inherit?'
<BBE> And having taken the cup, having given thanks, he gave to them, and they drank of it -- all;
<BBE> And Adonijah heareth, and all those called, who  with him, and they have finished to eat, and Joab heareth the noise of the trumpet, and saith, `Wherefore  the noise of the city roaring?'
<BBE> And they were astonished beyond measure, saying unto themselves, `And who is able to be saved?'
<BBE> and having put on the new, which is renewed in regard to knowledge, after the image of Him who did create him;
<BBE> then come in do two women, harlots, unto the king, and stand before him,
<BBE> Verily I say to you, wherever this good news may be proclaimed in the whole world, what also this woman did shall be spoken of -- for a memorial of her.'
<BBE> And Bath-Sheba cometh in unto the king, to the inner chamber, and the king  very aged, and Abishag the Shunammite is serving the king:
<BBE> in the rising again, then, whenever they may rise, of which of them shall she be wife -- for the seven had her as wife?'
<BBE> and he calleth against the altar, by the word of Jehovah, and saith, `Altar! altar! thus said Jehovah, Lo, a son is born to the house of David -- Josiah his name -- and he hath sacrificed on thee the priests of the high places who are making perfume on thee, and bones of man are burnt on thee.'
<BBE> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith to Peter, `Simon, thou dost sleep! thou wast not able to watch one hour!
<BBE> And they come to Jerusalem, and Jesus having gone into the temple, began to cast forth those selling and buying in the temple, and the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those selling the doves, he overthrew,
<BBE> and goeth after the man of God, and findeth him sitting under the oak, and saith unto him, `Art thou the man of God who hast come from Judah?' and he saith, `I .'
<BBE> And he saith, `Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, for he doth not turn back thy face, and he doth give to me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife.'
<BBE> and now, lo, Adonijah hath reigned, and now, my lord, O king, thou hast not known;
<BBE> for his sins that he sinned, to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, to walk in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin that he did, to cause Israel to sin;
<BBE> because they said, `He hath an unclean spirit.'
<BBE> And the house, in its being built, of perfect stone brought  hath been built, and hammer, and the axe -- any instrument of iron -- was not heard in the house, in its being built.
<BBE> And Hiram maketh the lavers, and the shovels, and the bowls; and Hiram completeth to do all the work that he made for king Solomon,  the house of Jehovah;
<BBE> and he saith, I go out, and have been a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets; and He saith, Thou dost entice, and also thou art able; go out and do so.
<BBE> And he said to them, `Whenever ye may enter into a house, there remain till ye may depart thence,
<BBE> As a grain of mustard, which, whenever it may be sown on the earth, is less than any of the seeds that are on the earth;
<BBE> and Asa lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Jehoshaphat his son reigneth in his stead.
<BBE> And Jezebel his wife saith unto him, `Thou now dost execute rule over Israel! rise, eat bread, and let thy heart be glad, -- I do give to thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.'
<BBE> And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon  of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon  of refined gold -- there are none of silver; it was not reckoned in the days of Solomon for anything,
<BBE> The salt  good, but if the salt may become saltless, in what will ye season ? Have in yourselves salt, and have peace in one another.'
<BBE> And the Pharisees, having come near, questioned him, if it is lawful for a husband to put away a wife, tempting him,
<BBE> And he turneth back with him, and eateth bread in his house, and drinketh water.
<BBE> And having called near all the multitude, he said to them, `Hearken to me, ye all, and understand;
<BBE> he  son of a woman, a widow, of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father a man of Tyre, a worker in brass, and he is filled with the wisdom and the understanding, and the knowledge to do all work in brass -- and he cometh unto king Solomon, and doth all his work.
<BBE> O the happiness of thy men, O the happiness of thy servants -- these -- who are standing before thee continually, who are hearing thy wisdom!
<BBE> for Thou hast separated them to Thyself for an inheritance, out of all the peoples of the earth, as Thou didst speak by the hand of Moses Thy servant, in Thy bringing out our fathers from Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.'
<BBE> And king Asa hath summoned all Judah -- there is none exempt -- and they lift up the stones of Ramah, and its wood, that Baasha hath built, and king Asa buildeth with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
<BBE> And the king saith to him, `Do as he hath spoken, and fall upon him, and thou hast buried him, and turned aside the causeless blood which Joab shed, from off me, and from off the house of my father;
<BBE> And Solomon awaketh, and lo, a dream; and he cometh in to Jerusalem, and standeth before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and causeth to ascend burnt-offerings, and maketh peace-offerings. And he maketh a banquet for all his servants,
<BBE> And Jesus immediately, having heard the word that is spoken, saith to the chief of the synagogue, `Be not afraid, only believe.'
<BBE> and many first shall be last, and the last first.'
<BBE> and Jesus answering said to him, `Seest thou these great buildings? there may not be left a stone upon a stone, that may not be thrown down.'
<BBE> and saith unto his young man, `Go up, I pray thee, look attentively the way of the sea;' and he goeth up and looketh attentively, and saith, `There is nothing;' and he saith, `Turn back,' seven times.
<BBE> And in the house again his disciples of the same thing questioned him,
<BBE> And they gird sackcloth on their loins, and ropes  on their heads, and they come in unto the king of Israel, and say, `Thy servant Ben-Hadad hath said, Let me live, I pray thee;' and he saith, `Is he yet alive? he  my brother.'
<BBE> And he went forth again by the sea, and all the multitude was coming unto him, and he was teaching them,
<BBE> And his disciples answered him, `Whence shall any one be able these here to feed with bread in a wilderness?'
<BBE> And also by the hand of Jehu son of Hanani the prophet a word of Jehovah hath been concerning Baasha, and concerning his house, and concerning all the evil that he did in the eyes of Jehovah to provoke Him to anger with the work of his hands, to be like the house of Jeroboam, and concerning that for which he smote him.
<BBE> And there hath been in that day, An affirmation of Jehovah, The noise of a cry from the fish-gate, And of a howling from the Second, And of great destruction from the hills.
<BBE> As he is yet speaking, there come from the chief of the synagogue's [house, certain], saying -- `Thy daughter did die, why still dost thou harass the Teacher?'
<BBE> And all Israel hear of the judgment that the king hath judged, and fear because of the king, for they have seen that the wisdom of God  in his heart, to do judgment.
<BBE> and he was teaching, saying to them, `Hath it not been written -- My house a house of prayer shall be called for all the nations, and ye did make it a den of robbers?'
<BBE> and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh; so that they are no more two, but one flesh;
<BBE> And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple, and having looked round on all things, it being now evening, he went forth to Bethany with the twelve.
<BBE> and he cometh to the house of the chief of the synagogue, and seeth a tumult, much weeping and wailing;
<BBE> And the queen of Sheba seeth all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he built,
<BBE> and Rehoboam lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers, in the city of David, and the name of his mother  Naamah the Ammonitess, and reign doth Abijam his son in his stead.
<BBE> and saith to them, `Go away to the village that is over-against you, and immediately, entering into it, ye shall find a colt tied, on which no one of men hath sat, having loosed it, bring :
<BBE> and it cometh to pass, in Jezebel's cutting off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah taketh a hundred prophets, and hideth them, fifty men in a cave, and hath sustained them with bread and water --
<BBE> And so he hath made for the opening of the temple, side-posts of the oil-tree, from the fourth.
<BBE> for many shall come in my name, saying -- I am , and many they shall lead astray;
<BBE> the fathers! vex not your children, lest they be discouraged.
<BBE> And immediately the damsel arose, and was walking, for she was twelve years ; and they were amazed with a great amazement,

<BBE> and say to Archippus, `See to the ministration that thou didst receive in the Lord, that thou mayest fulfil it.'
<BBE> Go, say to Jeroboam, Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Because that I have made thee high out of the midst of the people, and appoint thee leader over my people Israel,
<BBE> serpents they shall take up; and if any deadly thing they may drink, it shall not hurt them; on the ailing they shall lay hands, and they shall be well.'
<BBE> And the porch of the pillars he hath made; fifty cubits its length, and thirty cubits its breadth, and the porch  before them, and pillars and a thick place  before them.
<BBE> and they declare to the king, saying, `Lo, Nathan the prophet;' and he cometh in before the king, and boweth himself to the king, on his face to the earth.
<BBE> `I have compassion upon the multitude, because now three days they do continue with me, and they have not what they may eat;
<BBE> And Jesus answering said to them, `For the stiffness of your heart he wrote you this command,
<BBE> and he was keeping silent, and did not answer anything. Again the chief priest was questioning him, and saith to him, `Art thou the Christ -- the Son of the Blessed?'
<BBE> and these  their names: Ben-Hur in the hill-country of Ephraim;
<BBE> their sons who are left behind them in the land, whom the sons of Israel have not been able to devote -- he hath even lifted up  them a tribute of service unto this day.
<BBE> for which also I labour, striving according to his working that is working in me in power.
<BBE> And evening having come, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all who were ill, and who were demoniacs,
<BBE> and they shall mock him, and scourge him, and spit on him, and kill him, and the third day he shall rise again.'
<BBE> for she said -- `If even his garments I may touch, I shall be saved;'
<BBE> that Jehovah appeareth unto Solomon a second time, as He appeared unto him in Gibeon,
<BBE> and they send unto Jezebel, saying, `Naboth was stoned, and is dead.'
<BBE> for he did heal many, so that they threw themselves on him, in order to touch him -- as many as had plagues;
<BBE> and having come, a poor widow did put in two mites, which are a farthing.
<BBE> and the word of Jehovah is unto him, saying,
<BBE> And Jesus, having heard, saith to them, `They who are strong have no need of a physician, but they who are ill; I came not to call righteous men, but sinners to reformation.'
<BBE> and saith to him, `See thou mayest say nothing to any one, but go away, thyself shew to the priest, and bring near for thy cleansing the things Moses directed, for a testimony to them.'
<BBE> and all, whatever ye may do -- out of soul work -- as to the Lord, and not to men,
<BBE> having known that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance -- for the Lord Christ ye serve;
<BBE> And it hath come to pass, at that time, I search Jerusalem with lights, And I have laid a charge on the men Who are hardened on their preserved things, Who are saying in their heart: Jehovah doth no good, nor doth He evil.
<BBE> And draw near do the days of David to die, and he chargeth Solomon his son, saying,
<BBE> And Benaiah son of Jehoiada goeth up and falleth upon him, and putteth him to death, and he is buried in his own house in the wilderness,
<BBE> and having returned, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy, and they had not known what they might answer him.
<BBE> `And thee I take, and thou hast reigned over all that thy soul desireth, and thou hast been king over Israel;
<BBE> and many times he was charging them that they might not make him manifest.
<BBE> and Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus -- having scourged  -- that he might be crucified.
<BBE> And they come unto him, bringing a paralytic, borne by four,
<BBE> And Solomon caused to ascend, three times in a year, burnt-offerings and peace-offerings on the altar that he built to Jehovah, and he perfumed it with that which  before Jehovah, and finished the house.

<BBE> And the rest of the matters of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<BBE> And Jehovah said unto Ahijah, `Lo, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to seek a word from thee concerning her son, for he is sick; thus and thus thou dost speak unto her, and it cometh to pass at her coming in, that she is making herself strange.'
<BBE> watch ye, therefore, for ye have not known when the lord of the house doth come, at even, or at midnight, or at cock-crowing, or at the morning;
<BBE> and the candlesticks, five on the right, and five on the left, before the oracle, of refined gold, and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,
<BBE> And Solomon goeth after Ashtoreth god of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites;
<BBE> Thou dost hear in the heavens, the settled place of Thy dwelling, and hast done according to all that the stranger calleth unto Thee for, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy name, to fear Thee like Thy people Israel, and to know that Thy name hath been called on this house which I have builded.
<BBE> and crieth unto Jehovah, and saith, `Jehovah my God, also on the widow with whom I am sojourning hast Thou done evil -- to put her son to death?'

<BBE> and ye are in him made full, who is the head of all principality and authority,
<BBE> thefts, covetous desires, wickedness, deceit, arrogance, an evil eye, evil speaking, pride, foolishness;
<BBE> Judah and Israel  many, as the sand that  by the sea for multitude, eating and drinking and rejoicing.
<BBE> And Omri doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and doth evil above all who  before him,
<BBE> And he goeth and findeth his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion are standing near the carcase -- the lion hath not eaten the carcase nor destroyed the ass.

<BBE> And he cometh in unto the king, and the king saith unto him, `Micaiah, do we go unto Ramoth-Gilead, to battle, or do we forbear?' and he saith unto him, `Go up, and prosper, and Jehovah hath given  into the hand of the king.'
<BBE> And those left flee to Aphek, unto the city, and the wall falleth on twenty and seven chief men who are left, and Ben-Hadad hath fled, and cometh in unto the city, into the innermost part.
<BBE> and may sleep, and may rise night and day, and the seed spring up and grow, he hath not known how;
