<ASV> And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead to make war? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are: my people as your people, my horses as your horses.
<ASV> Give your servant, then, a wise heart for judging your people, able to see what is good and what evil; for who is able to be the judge of this great people?
<ASV> In the twentieth year that Jeroboam was king of Israel, Asa became king over Judah.
<ASV> But he said, I have no knowledge of him, or of what you are saying: and he went out into the doorway; and there came the cry of a cock.
<ASV> They were to go with common shoes on their feet, and not to take two coats.
<ASV> And by evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he by himself on the land.
<ASV> What profit has a man if he gets all the world with the loss of his life?
<ASV> And the girl saw him, and said again to those who were near, This is one of them.
<ASV> And when the king went by, crying out to him he said, Your servant went out into the fight; and a man came out to me with another man and said, Keep this man: if by any chance he gets away, your life will be the price of his life, or you will have to give a talent of silver in payment.
<ASV> And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot;
<ASV> But Jezebel, his wife, came to him and said, Why is your spirit so bitter that you have no desire for food?
<ASV> And the priests took the ark of the agreement of the Lord and put it in its place in the inner room of the house, in the most holy place, under the wings of the winged ones.
<ASV> Because from inside, from the heart of men, come evil thoughts and unclean pleasures,
<ASV> And whenever you make a prayer, let there be forgiveness in your hearts, if you have anything against anyone; so that you may have forgiveness for your sins from your Father who is in heaven.
<ASV> Say to Archippus, See that you do the work which the Lord has given you to do.
<ASV> And on his looking round to see her who had done this thing,
<ASV> Saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? have you come to put an end to us? I see well who you are, the Holy One of God.
<ASV> And Jesus, looking on him and loving him, said, There is one thing needed: go, get money for your goods, and give it to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven: and come with me.
<ASV> So the Lord said to Solomon, Because you have done this, and have not kept my agreement and my laws, which I gave you, I will take the kingdom away from you by force and will give it to your servant.
<ASV> And the inmost room was twenty cubits square and twenty cubits high, plated over with clear gold, and he made an altar of cedar-wood, plating it with gold.
<ASV> In that day you will have no shame on account of all the things in which you did evil against me: for then I will take away from among you those who were lifted up in pride, and you will no longer be lifted up with pride in my holy mountain.
<ASV> And after a song of praise to God they went out to the Mountain of Olives.
<ASV> But the Lord said to David my father, You did well to have in your heart the desire to make a house for my name;
<ASV> Then the king of Israel went back to his house, bitter and angry, and came to Samaria.
<ASV> And Pilate again said in answer to them, What then am I to do to him to whom you give the name of the King of the Jews?
<ASV> Give ear to the prayers of your servant, and the prayers of your people Israel, when they make their prayers, turning to this place; give ear in heaven your living-place, and hearing, have mercy.
<ASV> And he said to them, Whoever puts away his wife and takes another, is false to his wife;
<ASV> And when Zimri saw that the town was taken, he went into the inner room of the king's house, and burning the house over his head, came to his end,
<ASV> And Pilate, desiring to do what was pleasing to the people, let Barabbas go free, and gave up Jesus, when he had been whipped, to be put to death on the cross.
<ASV> Then Adonijah, the son of Haggith, came to Bath-sheba, the mother of Solomon. And she said, Come you in peace? And he said, Yes, in peace.
<ASV> Among whom you were living in the past, when you did such things.
<ASV> Which has come to you; and which in all the world is giving fruit and increase, as it has done in you from the day when it came to your ears and you had true knowledge of the grace of God;
<ASV> Who is the image of the unseen God coming into existence before all living things;
<ASV> And there came to him Sadducees, who say there is no coming back from the dead; and they put a question to him, saying,
<ASV> This was the Lord's doing, and it is a wonder in our eyes?
<ASV> But of that day or that hour no one has knowledge, not even the angels in heaven, or the Son, but the Father.
<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Asa, and his power, and all he did, and the towns of which he was the builder, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah? But when he was old he had a disease of the feet.
<ASV> But if you are turned from my ways, you or your children, and do not keep my orders and my laws which I have put before you, but go and make yourselves servants to other gods and give them worship:
<ASV> And let him who is on the house-top not go down, or go in, to take anything out of his house:
<ASV> Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying,
<ASV> Then Shimei got up, and making ready his ass, he went to Gath, to Achish, in search of his servants; and he sent and got them from Gath.
<ASV> And made strong prayers to him, saying, My little daughter is near to death: it is my prayer that you will come and put your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and have life.
<ASV> But to be seated at my right hand or at my left is not for me to give: but it is for those for whom it has been made ready.
<ASV> And they gave him wine mixed with myrrh; but he did not take it.
<ASV> But the supporters of Omri overcame those who were on the side of Tibni, the son of Ginath; and death came to Tibni and to his brother Joram at that time: and Omri became king in the place of Tibni.
<ASV> And on the square sides between the frames were lions, oxen, and winged ones; and the same on the frame; and over and under the lions and the oxen and the winged ones were steps.
<ASV> Because I took you up out of the dust, and made you ruler over my people Israel; and you have gone in the ways of Jeroboam, and made my people Israel do evil, moving me to wrath by their sins;
<ASV> And said to them, What is your opinion? What answer are we to give to this people who have said to me, Make less the weight of the yoke which your father put on us?
<ASV> And Solomon did evil in the eyes of the Lord, not walking in the Lord's ways with all his heart as David his father did.
<ASV> And when they were unable to get near him because of all the people, they got the roof uncovered where he was: and when it was broken up, they let down the bed on which the man was.
<ASV> And he took the blind man by the hand, and went with him out of the town; and when he had put water from his mouth on his eyes, and put his hands on him, he said, Do you see anything?
<ASV> And the king's servants came to our lord King David, blessing him and saying, May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and the seat of his authority greater than your seat; and the king was bent low in worship on his bed.
<ASV> Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah.
<ASV> Whom we are preaching; guiding and teaching every man in all wisdom, so that every man may be complete in Christ;
<ASV> Then the king sent for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make you take an oath by the Lord, protesting to you and saying, Be certain that on the day when you go out from here, wherever you go, death will overtake you? and you said to me, Very well!
<ASV> But is it truly possible that God may be housed on earth? see, heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be your resting-place; how much less this house which I have made!
<ASV> But a certain one of those who were near took out his sword, and gave the servant of the high priest a blow, cutting off his ear.
<ASV> And while he was going out into the way, a man came running to him, and went down on his knees, saying, Good Master, what have I to do so that I may have eternal life?
<ASV> And he said to him, These are the words of the Lord: Because you have let go from your hands the man whom I had put to the curse, your life will be taken for his life, and your people for his people.
<ASV> And straight away when he became king and took his place on the seat of the kingdom, he put to death all the family of Baasha: not one male child of his relations or his friends kept his life.
<ASV> Where their worm is ever living and the fire is not put out.
<ASV> Then Solomon put up a high place for Chemosh, the disgusting god of Moab, in the mountain before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the disgusting god worshipped by the children of Ammon.
<ASV> And say a prayer that it may not be in the winter.
<ASV> And about sundown a cry went up from all parts of the army, saying, Let every man go back to his town and his country, for the king is dead.
<ASV> And the great water-vessel, with the twelve oxen under it;
<ASV> But Jesus said to them, Because of your hard hearts he gave you this law.
<ASV> These were the chiefs of the overseers of Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, in authority over the people who did the work.
<ASV> And the young girl got up straight away, and was walking about; she being twelve years old. And they were overcome with wonder.
<ASV> A war-carriage might be got from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.
<ASV> And if you give attention to the orders I give you, walking in my ways and doing what is right in my eyes and keeping my laws and my orders as David my servant did; then I will be with you, building up for you a safe house, as I did for David, and I will give Israel to you.
<ASV> And one of the number said to him in answer, Master, I came to you with my son, who has in him a spirit which takes away his power of talking;
<ASV> Now the time of David's death came near; and he gave orders to Solomon his son, saying,
<ASV> Now after a long time, the word of the Lord came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go and let Ahab see you, so that I may send rain on the earth.
<ASV> Now after the meal he made ready the ass for him, for the prophet whom he had taken back.
<ASV> Truly, I will see that Baasha and all his family are completely brushed away; I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.
<ASV> Now he who had been false to him had given them a sign, saying, The one to whom I give a kiss, that is he; take him, and get him away safely.
<ASV> And Peter had come after him at a distance, even into the house of the high priest; and he was seated with the captains, warming himself in the light of the fire.
<ASV> And straight away the Spirit sent him out into the waste land.
<ASV> And when they came up with him, they said to him, Everyone is looking for you.
<ASV> And Solomon said, Great was your mercy to David my father, as his life before you was true and upright and his heart was true to you; and you have kept for him this greatest mercy, a son to take his place this day.
<ASV> But the days will come when the husband will be taken away from them, and then they will go without food.
<ASV> And they made one, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, who was going by, coming from the country, go with them, so that he might take his cross.
<ASV> Then the king made answer and said, Give her the child, and do not put it to death; she is the mother of it.
<ASV> And, as if honouring him, they said, Long life to the King of the Jews!
<ASV> Now at the feast every year he let one prisoner go free at their request.
<ASV> Then a man of God came from Judah by the order of the Lord to Beth-el, where Jeroboam was by the altar, burning offerings.
<ASV> In the night, this woman, sleeping on her child, was the cause of its death.
<ASV> And while she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.
<ASV> Who will not get a hundred times as much now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and land--though with great troubles; and, in the world to come, eternal life.
<ASV> The same day he gave them a sign, saying, This is the sign which the Lord has given: See, the altar will be broken and the burned waste on it overturned.
<ASV> But whoever says evil things against the Holy Spirit will never have forgiveness, but the evil he has done will be with him for ever:
<ASV> Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as David his father did.
<ASV> And the chance came when Herod on his birthday gave a feast to his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee;
<ASV> But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no other prophet of the Lord here from whom we may get directions?
<ASV> But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, It is a prophet, even like one of the prophets.
<ASV> And he was king for forty-one years in Jerusalem; his mother's name was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom.
<ASV> At the coming of Christ who is our life, you will be seen with him in glory.
<ASV> And when they had come, they said to him, Master, we are certain that you are true, and have no fear of anyone: you have no respect for a man's position, but you are teaching the true way of God: Is it right to give taxes to Caesar or not?
<ASV> And Solomon got together war-carriages and horsemen; he had one thousand, four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he kept, some in the carriage-towns and some with the king at Jerusalem.
<ASV> And now, see, Adonijah has made himself king without my lord's knowledge;
<ASV> So the king gave orders to Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada; and he went out and, falling on him, put him to death. And Solomon's authority over the kingdom was complete.
<ASV> Truly, I say to you, The sons of men will have forgiveness for all their sins and for all the evil words they say:
<ASV> And he said to them, Take care to be on the watch against the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.
<ASV> Then Ben-hadad sent to him, saying, May the gods' punishment be on me if there is enough of the dust of Samaria for all the people at my feet to take some in their hands.
<ASV> At that time Solomon made Pharaoh's daughter come up from the town of David to the house which he had made for her: then he made the Millo.
<ASV> May the Lord your God be praised, whose pleasure it was to put you on the seat of the kingdom of Israel; because the Lord's love for Israel is eternal, he has made you king, to be their judge in righteousness.
<ASV> And they took the food, and had enough; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken bits.
<ASV> And if they take thought, in the land where they are prisoners, and are turned again to you, crying out in prayer to you in that land, and saying, We are sinners, we have done wrong, we have done evil;
<ASV> And he went with him; and a great number of people went after him, and came round him.
<ASV> For he had made such a great number well that all those who were diseased were falling down before him for the purpose of touching him.
<ASV> And had seen that some of his disciples took their bread with unclean, that is, unwashed, hands.
<ASV> Now by the living Lord, who has given me my place on the seat of David my father, and made me one of a line of kings, as he gave me his word, truly Adonijah will be put to death this day.
<ASV> And straight away, while he was still talking, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great band with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority.
<ASV> And in the house the disciples put questions to him again about this thing.
<ASV> And he made ten wheeled bases of brass; every one four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.
<ASV> And he put up the line of side rooms against the walls of the house, fifteen cubits high, resting against the house on boards of cedar-wood.
<ASV> Then the fire of the Lord came down, burning up the offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and drinking up the water in the drain.
<ASV> ... the son of Deker in Makaz and Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh and Elonbeth-hanan;
<ASV> So after searching through all the land of Israel for a fair young girl, they saw Abishag the Shunammite, and took her to the king.
<ASV> And take with you ten cakes of bread and dry cakes and a pot of honey, and go to him: he will give you word of what is to become of the child.
<ASV> And straight away the king sent out one of his armed men, and gave him an order to come back with the head: and he went and took off John's head in prison,
<ASV> Still, let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant, O Lord God, and to his prayer for grace; give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant sends up to you this day;
<ASV> So he went and did as the Lord said, living by the stream Cherith, east of Jordan.
<ASV> And while he was still talking, they came from the ruler of the Synagogue's house, saying, Your daughter is dead: why are you still troubling the Master?
<ASV> And get two good-for-nothing persons to come before him and give witness that he has been cursing God and the king. Then take him out and have him stoned to death.
<ASV> And had undergone much at the hands of a number of medical men, and had given all she had, and was no better, but even worse,
<ASV> And he said to them, Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil? to give life or to put to death? But they said nothing.
<ASV> And Solomon was looking for a chance to put Jeroboam to death; but he went in flight to Egypt, to Shishak, king of Egypt, and was in Egypt till the death of Solomon.
<ASV> Azariah, the son of Nathan, was over those in authority in the different divisions of the country; Zabud, the son of Nathan, was priest and the king's friend;
<ASV> And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, You will take of the cup from which I take; and the baptism which I am about to undergo you will undergo:
<ASV> Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying,
<ASV> And at the top of the base there was a round vessel, half a cubit high;
<ASV> And if anyone says to you, Why are you doing this? say, The Lord has need of him and will send him back straight away.
<ASV> (And the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying,
<ASV> Then he made pillars of olive-wood for the way into the Temple; the pillars were square:
<ASV> Praise be to the Lord who has given rest to his people Israel, as he gave them his word to do; every word of all his oath, which he gave by the hand of Moses his servant, has come true.
<ASV> And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
<ASV> And Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord, even worse than all those before him,
<ASV> So you are to keep watch: because you are not certain when the master of the house is coming, in the evening, or in the middle of the night, or at the cock's cry, or in the morning;
<ASV> These things seem to have a sort of wisdom in self-ordered worship and making little of oneself, and being cruel to the body, not honouring it by giving it its natural use.
<ASV> And they came again to Jerusalem: and while he was walking in the Temple, there came to him the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority:
<ASV> And wherever he went, into small towns, or great towns, or into the country, they took those who were ill into the market-places, requesting him that they might put their hands even on the edge of his robe: and all those who did so were made well.
<ASV> And on the day after, when they had come out from Bethany, he was in need of food.
<ASV> Because of the sins which Jeroboam did and made Israel do, moving the Lord, the God of Israel, to wrath.
<ASV> For then I will give the people a clean language, so that they may all make prayer to the Lord and be his servants with one mind.
<ASV> And when the time came, he sent a servant to get from the workmen some of the fruit of the garden.
<ASV> For when Jezebel was cutting off the prophets of the Lord, Obadiah took a hundred of them, and kept them secretly in a hole in the rock, fifty at a time, and gave them bread and water.)
<ASV> And Jesus said to him, If you are able! All things are possible to him who has faith.
<ASV> And the pots and the spades and the basins; all the vessels which Hiram made for King Solomon, for the house of the Lord, were of polished brass.
<ASV> And if your foot is a cause of trouble to you, let it be cut off: it is better for you to go into life with one foot than to have two feet and go into hell.
<ASV> And the king said to the man of God, Come with me to my house for food and rest, and I will give you a reward.
<ASV> But I will not take the kingdom from him; I will let him be king all the days of his life, because of David my servant, in whom I took delight because he kept my orders and my laws.
<ASV> And if the Lord had not made the time short, no flesh would have been kept from destruction; but because of the saints he has made the time short.
<ASV> And they took him, and gave him blows, and sent him away with nothing.
<ASV> And he put them under orders not to say this of him to anyone.
<ASV> And who, himself, made clear to us your love in the Spirit.
<ASV> And in that day I will send punishment on all those who come jumping over the doorstep and make their master's house full of violent behaviour and deceit.
<ASV> And he said to them, But who do you say I am? Peter said in answer, You are the Christ.
<ASV> And give them the power of driving out evil spirits:
<ASV> And with a number of such stories he gave them his teaching, as they were able to take it:
<ASV> So the king did not give ear to the people; and this came about by the purpose of the Lord, so that what he had said by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, son of Nebat, might be effected.
<ASV> Who went with him when he was in Galilee and took care of him; and a number of other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
<ASV> And some of those who were near, hearing it, said, See, he is crying to Elijah.
<ASV> When I made a division of the five cakes of bread among the five thousand, what number of baskets full of broken bits did you take up? They said to him, Twelve.
<ASV> So that the Lord may give effect to what he said of me, If your children give attention to their ways, living uprightly before me with all their heart and their soul, you will never be without a man to be king in Israel.
<ASV> And he said to his servant, Go now, and take a look in the direction of the sea. And he went up, and after looking said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times; and he went seven times.
<ASV> And the Pharisees came out and put questions to him, requesting from him a sign from heaven, testing him.
<ASV> (For they will have news of your great name and your strong hand and your out-stretched arm;) when he comes to make his prayer, turning to this house:
<ASV> Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem;
<ASV> And he was unable to do any work of power there, but only to put his hands on one or two persons who were ill, and make them well.
<ASV> Three times in the year it was Solomon's way to give burned offerings and peace-offerings on the altar he had made to the Lord, causing his fire-offering to go up on the altar before the Lord.
<ASV> And he will give Israel up because of the sins which Jeroboam has done and made Israel do.
<ASV> And seeing a fig-tree in the distance with leaves, he went to see if by chance it had anything on it: and when he came to it, he saw nothing but leaves, for it was not the time for the fruit.
<ASV> And what would a man give in exchange for his life?
<ASV> Because of his sin in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord, in going in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he made Israel do.
<ASV> And when he had news of it from the captain, he let Joseph have the body.
<ASV> And Jesus, having knowledge in his spirit of their thoughts, said to them, Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?
<ASV> Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.
<ASV> Keep your mind on the higher things, not on the things of earth.
<ASV> Nation will go to war with nation, and kingdom with kingdom: there will be earth-shocks in different places; there will be times when there is no food; these things are the first of the troubles.
<ASV> Then the king, hearing the man of God crying out against the altar at Beth-el, put out his hand from the altar, saying, Take him prisoner. And his hand, stretched out against him, became dead, and he had no power of pulling it back.
<ASV> And whatever you do, in word or in act, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving praise to God the Father through him.
<ASV> And the word of the Lord came to Jehu, son of Hanani, protesting against Baasha and saying,
<ASV> And Elijah, hearing it, went out, covering his face with his robe, and took his place in the opening of the hole. And there a voice came to him saying, What are you doing here, Elijah?
<ASV> And the second took her, and at his death there were no offspring; and the third the same:
<ASV> And the two will become one flesh; so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.
<ASV> There is nothing covered which will not be seen openly, and nothing has been made secret which will not come to light.
<ASV> Rooted and based together in him, strong in the faith which the teaching gave you, giving praise to God at all times.
<ASV> But, with curses and oaths, he said, I have no knowledge of the man about whom you are talking.
<ASV> And all the time, by day and by night, in the place of the dead, and in the mountains, he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.
<ASV> And to have love for him with all the heart, and with all the mind, and with all the strength, and to have the same love for his neighbour as for himself, is much more than all forms of offerings.
<ASV> For he had authority over all the country on this side of the River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all the kings on this side of the River; and he had peace round him on every side.
<ASV> Sorrow to her who is uncontrolled and unclean, the cruel town!
<ASV> And Solomon was ruler over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the edge of Egypt; men gave him offerings and were his servants all the days of his life.
<ASV> And Jesus said to him sharply, Be quiet, and come out of him.
<ASV> And the angel of the Lord came again a second time, and touching him said, Get up and have some food, or the journey will be overmuch for your strength.
<ASV> And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, the building of the house was complete in every detail, as it had been designed. So he was seven years building it.
<ASV> Through the hope which is in store for you in heaven; knowledge of which was given to you before in the true word of the good news,
<ASV> Then Jeroboam's wife got up and went away and came to Tirzah; and when she came to the doorway of the house, death came to the child.
<ASV> And stretching herself out on the child three times, he made his prayer to the Lord, saying, O Lord my God, be pleased to let this child's life come back to him again.
<ASV> And keep the orders of the Lord your God, walking in his ways, keeping his laws and his orders and his rules and his words, as they are recorded in the law of Moses; so that you may do well in all you do and wherever you go,
<ASV> And Jesus said to them, Give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's. And they were full of wonder at him.
<ASV> Then David went to rest with his fathers, and his body was put into the earth in the town of David.
<ASV> Whoever gives you a cup of water, because you are Christ's, truly I say to you, he will in no way be without his reward.
<ASV> And Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the little towns round Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he put a question to his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I am?
<ASV> And after the earth-shock a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, the sound of a soft breath.
<ASV> So they put on haircloth, and cords on their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, Your servant Ben-hadad says, Let me now keep my life. And he said, Is he still living? he is my brother.
<ASV> He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, copying the evil ways of his father, and the sin which he did and made Israel do.
<ASV> Why does this man say such things? he has no respect for God: from whom does forgiveness come but from God only?
<ASV> Now a number of strange women were loved by Solomon, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:
<ASV> And some went among the thorns, and the thorns came up, and it had no room for growth and gave no fruit.
<ASV> Then the king said to him, Have I not, again and again, put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the Lord?
<ASV> The taking of goods and of life, broken faith between husband and wife, the desire of wealth, wrongdoing, deceit, sins of the flesh, an evil eye, angry words, pride, foolish acts:
<ASV> And they said to him, Let us be seated, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.
<ASV> And the floor of the house was covered with gold, inside and out.
<ASV> So then the Lord Jesus, after he had said these words to them, was taken up into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of God.
<ASV> I will take away everything from the face of the earth, says the Lord.
<ASV> And even now the hand of the Lord has come down on Israel, shaking it like a river-grass in the water; and, uprooting Israel from this good land, which he gave to their fathers, he will send them this way and that on the other side of the River; because they have made for themselves images, moving the Lord to wrath.
<ASV> And on the first day of unleavened bread, when the Passover lamb is put to death, his disciples said to him, Where are we to go and make ready for you to take the Passover meal?

<ASV> But I had no faith in what was said about you, till I came and saw for myself; and now I see that it was not half the story; your wisdom and your wealth are much greater than they said.
<ASV> And the cups and the scissors and the basins and the spoons and the fire-trays, all of gold; and the pins on which the doors were turned, the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and the doors of the Temple, all of gold.
<ASV> Your father put a hard yoke on us: if you will make the conditions under which your father kept us down less cruel, and the weight of the yoke he put on us less hard, then we will be your servants.
<ASV> Which is the simpler, to say to a man who is ill, You have forgiveness for your sins, or, Get up, take up your bed, and go?
<ASV> And Jeroboam gave orders for a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast which is kept in Judah, and he went up to the altar. And in the same way, in Beth-el, he gave offerings to the oxen which he had made, placing in Beth-el the priests of the high places he had made.
<ASV> And all Israel put his body to rest, weeping over him, as the Lord had said by his servant Ahijah the prophet.

<ASV> And Elijah came near to all the people and said, How long will you go on balancing between two opinions? if the Lord is God, then give worship to him; but if Baal, give worship to him. And the people said not a word in answer.
<ASV> And the Lord sent his word against Baasha and his family by the mouth of the prophet Jehu, the son of Hanani, because of all the evil he did in the eyes of the Lord, moving him to wrath by the work of his hands, because he was like the family of Jeroboam, and because he put it to death.
<ASV> Now you have with you Shimei, the son of Gera the Benjamite of Bahurim, who put a bitter curse on me on the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to see me at Jordan, and I gave him my oath by the Lord, saying, I will not put you to death by the sword.
<ASV> When heaven is shut up and there is no rain, because of their sin against you; if they make prayers with their faces turned to this place, honouring your name and turning away from their sin when you send trouble on them:
<ASV> These were placed inside the inner house, their outstretched wings touching the walls of the house, one touching one wall and one the other, while their other wings were touching in the middle.
<ASV> Then at the time of the offering, Elijah the prophet came near and said, O Lord, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be seen this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things by your order.

<ASV> And Herodias was bitter against him, desiring to put him to death; but she was not able;
<ASV> And he took with him Peter and James and John, and grief and great trouble came on him.

<ASV> And from the sandal-wood the king made pillars for the house of the Lord, and for the king's house, and instruments of music for the makers of melody: never has such sandal-wood been seen to this day.
<ASV> I am going the way of all the earth: so be strong and be a man;
<ASV> And the king said, Do as he has said and make an attack on him there, and put his body into the earth; so that you may take away from me and from my family the blood of one put to death by Joab without cause.

<ASV> But they, when they saw him walking on the sea, took him for a spirit, and gave a loud cry:
<ASV> And he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and, looking up to heaven, he said words of blessing over them; and when the cakes were broken, he gave them to the disciples to put before the people; and he made division of the two fishes among them all.
<ASV> Give ear in heaven to their prayer and their cry for grace, and see right done to them.
<ASV> But if we say, From men--they were in fear of the people, because all took John to be truly a prophet.
<ASV> And later he was seen by the eleven themselves while they were taking food; and he said sharp words to them because they had no faith and their hearts were hard, and because they had no belief in those who had seen him after he had come back from the dead.
<ASV> And it will be hard for women who are with child and for her who has a baby at the breast in those days.

<ASV> The nations of which the Lord had said to the children of Israel, You are not to take wives from them and they are not to take wives from you; or they will certainly make you go after their gods: to these Solomon was united in love.
<ASV> And he gave them teaching in the form of stories. A man had a vine-garden planted, and put a wall about it, and made a place for crushing out the wine, and put up a tower, and let it out to field-workers, and went into another country.
<ASV> And there he went into a hole in the rock for the night; then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, What are you doing here, Elijah?
<ASV> And he said that they were to take nothing for their journey, but a stick only; no bread, no bag, no money in their pockets;

<ASV> And from all over the earth they came to see Solomon and to give ear to his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
<ASV> And more than this, there were those in the land who were used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods, doing the same disgusting crimes as the nations which the Lord had sent out before the children of Israel.

<ASV> And a cloud came over them; and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly loved Son, give ear to him.
<ASV> Being certain that the Lord will give you the reward of the heritage: for you are the servants of the Lord Christ.
<ASV> And he said to them, If you are not clear about this story, how will you be clear about the others?
<ASV> Then Solomon took his place before the altar of the Lord, all the men of Israel being present, and stretching out his hands to heaven,
<ASV> And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
<ASV> And had given him orders about this very thing, that he was not to go after other gods; but he did not keep the orders of the Lord.
<ASV> Then Bath-sheba went down on her face on the earth before the king giving him honour, and said, May my lord King David go on living for ever.
<ASV> And he gave them special orders that they were not to say anything of this; and he said that some food was to be given to her.
<ASV> And Bath-sheba said, Good! I will make your request to the king.
<ASV> And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.
<ASV> As for you, if you will go on your way before me, as David your father did, uprightly and with a true heart, doing what I have given you orders to do, keeping my laws and my decisions;
<ASV> So his servants said to him, Let search be made for a young virgin for my lord the king, to take care of him and be waiting on him; and you may take her in your arms, and so my lord the king will be warm.
<ASV> So he went away from there and came across Elisha, the son of Shaphat, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen, he himself walking with the twelfth; and Elijah went up to him and put his robe on him.
<ASV> I have done as you said: I have given you a wise and far-seeing heart, so that there has never been your equal in the past, and never will there be any like you in the future.
<ASV> Ahimaaz in Naphtali; he took Basemath, the daughter of Solomon, as his wife;
<ASV> The great outer square all round was walled with three lines of squared stones and a line of cedar-wood boards, round about the open square inside the house of the Lord and the covered room of the king's house.
<ASV> And Jesus said to him, What would you have me do to you? And the blind man said, Master, make me able to see.
<ASV> And to Abiathar the priest the king said, Go to Anathoth, to your fields; for death would be your right reward; but I will not put you to death now, because you took up the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and you were with him in all his troubles.
<ASV> And they were placed in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
<ASV> He put up the pillars at the doorway of the Temple, naming the one on the right Jachin, and that on the left Boaz.
<ASV> ... the son of Abinadab in all Naphath-dor; his wife was Taphath, the daughter of Solomon.
<ASV> And the seventh time he said, I see a cloud coming up out of the sea, as small as a man's hand. Then he said, Go up and say to Ahab, Get your carriage ready and go down or the rain will keep you back.
<ASV> And has put to death oxen and fat beasts and sheep in great numbers, and has sent for all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab, the captain of the army; but he has not sent for Solomon your servant.

<ASV> And when he had gone into the house away from all the people, his disciples put questions to him about the saying.
<ASV> He was living in the place of the dead: and no man was able to keep him down, no, not with a chain;
<ASV> Now the servant who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, See now, all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king; so let your words be like theirs and say good things.
<ASV> Baana, the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is by the side of Zarethan, under Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as the far side of Jokmeam;
<ASV> And all the responsible men of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
<ASV> David was king over Israel for forty years: for seven years he was king in Hebron and for thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
<ASV> Then Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me; and all the people came near. And he put up again the altar of the Lord which had been broken down.
<ASV> But as to the dead coming back to life; have you not seen in the book of Moses, about the burning thorn-tree, how God said to him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
<ASV> The store of meal did not come to an end, and the bottle was never without oil, as the Lord had said by the mouth of Elijah.

<ASV> And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, went down before him, crying out, and saying, You are the Son of God.

<ASV> And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal, let not one of them get away. So they took them, and Elijah made them go down to the stream Kishon, and put them to death there.

<ASV> Now there was war between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, all their days.
<ASV> And God sent another trouble-maker, Rezon, the son of Eliada, who had gone in flight from his lord, Hadadezer, king of Zobah:
<ASV> But he said to them in answer, Give them food yourselves. And they said to him, Are we to go and get bread for two hundred pence, and give it to them?
<ASV> If they do wrong against you, (for no man is without sin,) and you are angry with them and give them up into the power of those who are fighting against them, so that they take them away as prisoners into a strange land, far off or near;
<ASV> For Solomon went after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and Milcom, the disgusting god of the Ammonites.
<ASV> Then King Asa got all Judah together, making every man come; and they took away the stones and the wood with which Baasha was building Ramah, and King Asa made use of them for building Geba in the land of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
<ASV> The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men? give me an answer.
<ASV> Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were seated on their seats of authority, dressed in their robes, by the doorway into Samaria; and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them.
<ASV> And they said to him, Ben-hadad says, Your silver and your gold are mine; and your wives and children are mine.
<ASV> But the fight became more violent while the day went on; and the king was supported in his war-carriage facing the Aramaeans, and the floor of the carriage was covered with the blood from his wound, and by evening he was dead.
<ASV> Now Simon's wife's mother was ill, with a burning heat; and they gave him word of her:
<ASV> And he said, What sin have I done, that you would give up your servant into the hand of Ahab, and be the cause of my death?
<ASV> There came Joseph of Arimathaea, a responsible man in high honour, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God; and he went in to Pilate without fear, and made a request for the body of Jesus.
<ASV> It was supported on twelve oxen, with their back parts turned to the middle of it, three of them facing to the north, three to the west, three to the south, and three to the east; the vessel was resting on top of them.
<ASV> And when he was getting into the boat, the man in whom had been the evil spirits had a great desire to come with him.
<ASV> And the base was of great masses of highly priced stone, some ten cubits and some eight cubits square.
<ASV> Hadad, being still a young boy, went in flight to Egypt, with certain Edomites, servants of his father;
<ASV> In the fourth year the base of the house was put in its place, in the month Ziv.
<ASV> For fear that, coming suddenly, he sees you sleeping.
<ASV> For John said to Herod, It is wrong for you to have your brother's wife.
<ASV> Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the purpose of God, and Timothy our brother,
<ASV> If I send them away to their houses with no food, they will be overcome by weariness on the way; and some of them have come from far.
<ASV> Then Jezebel, his wife, said, Are you now the ruler of Israel? Get up, take food, and let your heart be glad; I will give you the vine-garden of Naboth the Jezreelite.
<ASV> And he said this openly. And Peter took him, and was protesting.
<ASV> And they took him to the place named Golgotha, which is, Dead Man's Head.
<ASV> And it came to the ears of Adonijah and all the guests who were with him, when their meal was ended. And Joab, hearing the sound of the horn, said, What is the reason of this noise as if the town was worked up?
<ASV> And all the store-towns and the towns which Solomon had for his war-carriages and for his horsemen, and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land under his rule.
<ASV> But Peter said to him, Though the others may be turned away from you, I will not.
<ASV> Then the king of Israel sent for all the responsible men of the land, and said, Now will you take note and see the evil purpose of this man: he sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, and I did not keep them back.
<ASV> And Jonathan, answering, said to Adonijah, Not so, but our lord King David has made Solomon king:
<ASV> And being moved with pity, he put out his hand, and touching him said to him, It is my pleasure; be made clean.
<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he became king, are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
<ASV> And he let them do it. And the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs; and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea, about two thousand of them; and they came to their death in the sea.
<ASV> So he went back with him, and had a meal in his house and a drink of water.
<ASV> So now, O God of Israel, it is my prayer that you will make your word come true which you said to your servant David, my father.
<ASV> And when he saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, Is it you, you troubler of Israel?
<ASV> The wheels were made like carriage-wheels, the rods on which they were fixed, the parts forming their edges, their rods and the middle points of them, were all formed out of liquid metal.
<ASV> Go, say to Jeroboam, These are the words of the Lord, the God of Israel: Though I took you from among the people, lifting you up to be a ruler over my people Israel,
<ASV> And a voice came out of heaven, You are my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased.
<ASV> And he got out, and saw a great mass of people, and he had pity on them, because they were like sheep without a keeper: and he gave them teaching about a number of things.
<ASV> And these are their names: ... the son of Hur in the hill country of Ephraim;
<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his power, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
<ASV> Give yourselves to prayer at all times, keeping watch with praise;
<ASV> On the olive-wood doors were cut designs of winged ones and palm-trees and open flowers, all of them, with the doors, plated with gold.
<ASV> Because of the downfall of all the people of Canaan: all those who were weighted down with silver have been cut off.
<ASV> And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me: but even so let not my pleasure, but yours be done.
<ASV> With outstretched wings five cubits wide; the distance from the edge of one wing to the edge of the other was ten cubits.
<ASV> For so I was ordered by the word of the Lord, who said, You are not to take food or a drink of water, and you are not to go back the way you came.
<ASV> And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
<ASV> A blessing on the coming kingdom of our father David: Glory in the highest.
<ASV> And straight away, when I have gone from you, the spirit of the Lord will take you away, I have no idea where, so that when I come and give word to Ahab, and he sees you not, he will put me to death: though I, your servant, have been a worshipper of the Lord from my earliest years.
<ASV> Still I will not take all the kingdom from him; but I will give one tribe to your son, because of my servant David, and because of Jerusalem, the town of my selection.
<ASV> For Herod himself had sent men out to take John and put him in prison, because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had taken for himself.
<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all he did, and his wisdom, are they not recorded in the book of the acts of Solomon?
<ASV> And he said, Give ear now to the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord seated on his seat of power, with all the army of heaven in their places round him at his right hand and at his left.
<ASV> And very early after dawn on the first day of the week, they came at the time of the coming up of the sun to the place where the body had been put.
<ASV> As, then, you took Christ Jesus the Lord, so go on in him,
<ASV> And the twelve came together to Jesus; and they gave him an account of all the things they had done, and all they had been teaching.
<ASV> Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and have belief. And those who were put on crosses with him said evil things against him.
<ASV> Because it goes not into the heart but into the stomach, and goes out with the waste? He said this, making all food clean.
<ASV> Is not this the woodworker, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were bitter against him.
<ASV> But the people were moved by the chief priests to make him let Barabbas go free.
<ASV> The water of the stream will be your drink, and by my orders the ravens will give you food there.
<ASV> And there were four angle-plates at the four angles of every base, forming part of the structure of the base.
<ASV> You have knowledge of what is said in the law, Do not put any one to death, Do not be untrue in married life, Do not take what is not yours, Do not give false witness, Do not get money by deceit, Give honour to your father and mother.
<ASV> And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and put Solomon my son on my beast, yes, mine, and take him down to Gihon;
<ASV> For Moses said, Give honour to your father and mother, and, He who says evil of father or mother, let him have the punishment of death:
<ASV> And he said to them in answer, O generation without faith, how long will I have to be with you? how long will I put up with you? let him come to me.
<ASV> So Asa went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son became king in his place.
<ASV> And Jesus, looking round about, said to his disciples, How hard it is for those who have wealth to come into the kingdom of God!
<ASV> And when his friends had news of it, they went out to get him, saying, He is off his head.
<ASV> And let not him who is in the field go back to take his coat.
<ASV> These were ornamented with designs of winged ones and palm-trees and open flowers, plated over with gold.
<ASV> Whoever has a desire to keep his life, will have it taken from him; and whoever gives up his life because of me and the good news, will keep it.
<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?
<ASV> And his hand will be stretched out against the north, for the destruction of Assyria; and he will make Nineveh unpeopled and dry like the waste land.
<ASV> And he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath;
<ASV> For it was not clear to them about the bread; but their hearts were hard.
<ASV> And going by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew, the brother of Simon, putting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen.
<ASV> Now, let them give us two oxen; and let them take one for themselves, and have it cut up, and put it on the wood, but put no fire under it; I will get the other ox ready, and put it on the wood, and put no fire under it.
<ASV> Which say there may be no touching, tasting, or taking in your hands,
<ASV> The Lord your God is among you, as a strong saviour: he will be glad over you with joy, he will make his love new again, he will make a song of joy over you as in the time of a holy feast.
<ASV> Being gentle to one another and having forgiveness for one another, if anyone has done wrong to his brother, even as the Lord had forgiveness for you:
<ASV> And the Lord will put up a king over Israel who will send destruction on the family of Jeroboam in that day;
<ASV> And Judah did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and made him more angry than their fathers had done by their sins.
<ASV> And they came to Beth-saida. And they took a blind man to him, requesting him to put his hands on him.
<ASV> (Rules which are all to come to an end with their use) after the orders and teaching of men?
<ASV> And suddenly looking round about, they saw no one any longer, but Jesus only with themselves.

<ASV> And looking up to heaven, he took a deep breath, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be open.
<ASV> Make melody, O daughter of Zion; give a loud cry, O Israel; be glad and let your heart be full of joy, O daughter of Jerusalem.
<ASV> Then she said, By the life of the Lord your God, I have nothing but a little meal in my store, and a drop of oil in the bottle; and now I am getting two sticks together so that I may go in and make it ready for me and my son, so that we may have a meal before our death.
<ASV> And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house, he put the question to them, What were you talking about on the way?
<ASV> And the house, that is, the Temple, in front of the holy place was forty cubits long.
<ASV> In whom we have our salvation, the forgiveness of sins:
<ASV> Give ear in heaven your living-place, acting in mercy; and give to every man whose secret heart is open to you, the reward of all his ways; for you, and you only, have knowledge of the hearts of all the children of men:
<ASV> Get up, let us be going; see, he who gives me up is near.
<ASV> And straight away the disease went from him, and he was made clean.
<ASV> So he said to the representatives of Ben-hadad, Say to my lord the king, All the orders you sent the first time I will do; but this thing I may not do. And the representatives went back with this answer.
<ASV> And he is the head of the body, the church: the starting point of all things, the first to come again from the dead; so that in all things he might have the chief place.
<ASV> But he gave no attention to the opinion of the old men, and went to the young men of his generation who were waiting before him:
<ASV> And when Jesus saw that he gave a wise answer, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And every man after that was in fear of questioning him any more.
<ASV> So they gave loud cries, cutting themselves with knives and swords, as was their way, till the blood came streaming out all over them.
<ASV> And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
<ASV> There were three lines of window-frames, window facing window in every line.
<ASV> He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, going in the ways of his father and his mother, and in the ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel do evil.
<ASV> And he made places for worship at the high places, and made priests, who were not Levites, from among all the people.
<ASV> And Jesus, answering, said to them, Have God's faith.
<ASV> And it came about in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was given baptism by John in the Jordan.
<ASV> And they had taken no thought to get bread; and they had only one cake of bread with them in the boat.
<ASV> And he would not let him, but said to him, Go to your house, to your friends, and give them news of the great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.
<ASV> Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of the rule of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, and he was king over Israel for two years.
<ASV> So that I may make it clear, as it is right for me to do.
<ASV> John said to him, Master, we saw one driving out evil spirits in your name: and we said that he might not, because he is not one of us.
<ASV> I have given you baptism with water, but he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit.
<ASV> And Baasha, king of Israel, went up against Judah, building Ramah, so that no one was able to go out or in to Asa, king of Judah.
<ASV> And the disciples were full of wonder at his words. But Jesus said to them again, Children, how hard it is for those who put faith in wealth to come into the kingdom of God!
<ASV> And their fear was great, and they said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea do his orders?
<ASV> And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
<ASV> But they said, Not while the feast is going on, for fear there may be trouble among the people.
<ASV> Now send, and get Israel together before me at Mount Carmel, with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal who get their food at Jezebel's table.
<ASV> And at the end of the day, his disciples came to him and said, This place is waste land, and it is late:
<ASV> The voice of one crying in the waste land, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his roads straight;
<ASV> Come now, go to King David and say to him, Did you not, O my lord, take an oath to me, your servant, saying, Truly Solomon your son will be king after me, seated on the seat of my kingdom? why then is Adonijah acting as king?
<ASV> Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, were scribes; Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the recorder;
<ASV> Wives, be under the authority of your husbands, as is right in the Lord.
<ASV> Whoever will give honour to one such little child in my name, gives honour to me: and whoever gives honour to me, gives honour not to me, but to him who sent me.
<ASV> And he came and took her by the hand, lifting her up; and she became well, and took care of their needs.
<ASV> If any man has ears, let him give ear.
<ASV> In addition to the chiefs of the responsible men put by Solomon to oversee the work, three thousand and three hundred in authority over the workmen.
<ASV> See, I will send evil on you and put an end to you completely, cutting off from Ahab every male child, him who is shut up and him who goes free in Israel;
<ASV> Aristarchus, my brother-prisoner, sends his love to you, and Mark, a relation of Barnabas (about whom you have been given orders: if he comes to you, be kind to him),
<ASV> Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, came near and gave Micaiah a blow on the side of the face, saying, Where is the spirit of the Lord whose word is in you?
<ASV> ... the son of Hesed in Arubboth; Socoh and all the land of Hepher were under his control;
<ASV> And their answer will be, Because they were turned away from the Lord their God, who took their fathers out of the land of Egypt; they took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants: that is why the Lord has sent all this evil on them.
<ASV> And when he had got out of the boat, straight away there came to him from the place of the dead a man with an unclean spirit.
<ASV> Then they sent to him certain of the Pharisees and the Herodians, so that they might make use of his words to take him by a trick.
<ASV> And brother will give up brother to death, and the father his child; and children will go against their fathers and mothers, and put them to death.
<ASV> And the people saw them going, and a number of them, having knowledge who they were, went running there together on foot from all the towns, and got there before them.
<ASV> She has done what she was able: she has put oil on my body to make it ready for its last resting-place.
<ASV> And the other woman said, No; but the living child is my son and the dead one yours. But the first said, No; the dead child is your son and the living one mine. So they kept on talking before the king.
<ASV> And Elijah said, By the life of the Lord of armies, whose servant I am, I will certainly let him see me today.
<ASV> And he will take you up himself to a great room with a table and seats: there make ready for us.
<ASV> But you say, If a man says to his father or his mother, That by which you might have had profit from me is Corban, that is to say, Given to God,
<ASV> So Bath-sheba went to King Solomon to have talk with him on Adonijah's account. And the king got up to come to her, and went down low to the earth before her; then he took his place on the king's seat and had a seat made ready for the king's mother and she took her place at his right hand.
<ASV> As saints of God, then, holy and dearly loved, let your behaviour be marked by pity and mercy, kind feeling, a low opinion of yourselves, gentle ways, and a power of undergoing all things;
<ASV> And he sent another; and they put him to death: and a number of others, whipping some, and putting some to death.
<ASV> And they went out from there, through Galilee; and it was his desire that no man might have knowledge of it;
<ASV> And the scribe said to him, Truly, Master, you have well said that he is one, and there is no other but he:
<ASV> Then Bath-sheba went into the king's room; now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was waiting on him.
<ASV> And the time Solomon was king in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
<ASV> And it will come about that the man who gets away safe from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will put to death; and whoever gets away safe from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will put to death.
<ASV> See that you say nothing to any man: but go and let the priest see you, and make yourself clean by an offering of the things ordered by Moses, for a witness to them.
<ASV> And the Pharisees went out, and straight away made designs with the Herodians about how they might put him to death.
<ASV> And King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she made request for, in addition to what he gave her freely from the impulse of his heart. So she went back to her country, she and her servants.
<ASV> So when the captains of the war-carriages saw Jehoshaphat, they said, Truly, this is the king of Israel; and turning against him, they came round him, but Jehoshaphat gave a cry.
<ASV> Jehoshaphat, the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
<ASV> And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the coming back from the dead might be.
<ASV> But he went out, and made it public, giving an account of it everywhere, so that Jesus was no longer able to go openly into a town, but was outside in the waste land; and they came to him from every part.
<ASV> Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
<ASV> And the good news has first to be given to all the nations.
<ASV> And he said to them, Take care what you give ear to: in the same measure as you give you will get, and more will be given to you.
<ASV> He who has, to him will be given: and he who has not, from him will be taken even that which he has.
<ASV> And the Lord had said to Ahijah, The wife of Jeroboam is coming to get news from you about her son, who is ill; give her such and such an answer; for she will make herself seem to be another woman.
<ASV> Then he said to him, I am a prophet like you; and an angel said to me by the word of the Lord, Take him back with you and give him food and water. But he said false words to him.
<ASV> And they went on from Midian and came to Paran; and, taking men from Paran with them, they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who gave him a house and gave orders for his food and gave him land.
<ASV> And Jesus said to him, Why do you say I am good? no one is good but one, and that is God.
<ASV> But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side; no one is making trouble, and no evil is taking place.
<ASV> And he put up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he had made in Samaria.
<ASV> And the amount of Solomon's food for one day was thirty measures of crushed grain and sixty measures of meal;
<ASV> Because of all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they did and made Israel do, moving the Lord, the God of Israel, to wrath by their foolish acts.
<ASV> For this reason, we, from the day when we had word of it, keep on in prayer for you, that you may be full of the knowledge of his purpose, with all wisdom and experience of the Spirit,
<ASV> And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem, said, He has Beelzebub, and, By the ruler of evil spirits he sends evil spirits out of men.
<ASV> The same day the king made holy the middle of the open square in front of the house of the Lord, offering there the burned offering and the meal offering and the fat of the peace-offerings; for there was not room on the brass altar of the Lord for the burned offerings and the meal offerings and the fat of the peace-offerings.
<ASV> Then the representatives came back again, and said, These are the words of Ben-hadad: I sent to you saying, Give up to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children;
<ASV> Jesus, looking on them, said, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.
<ASV> And it was covered with cedar over the forty-five supports which were on the pillars, fifteen in a line.
<ASV> When she had news of the things which Jesus did, went among the people coming after him, and put her hand on his robe.
<ASV> And the cares of this life, and the deceits of wealth, and the desire for other things coming in, put a stop to the growth of the word, and it gives no fruit.
<ASV> So I have made for you a living-place, a house in which you may be for ever present.
<ASV> And he put the body in the resting-place made ready for himself, weeping and sorrowing over it, saying, O my brother!
<ASV> And Solomon said, If he is seen to be a man of good faith, not a hair of him will be touched; but if any wrongdoing is seen in him, he is to be put to death.
<ASV> For this reason, go on waiting for me, says the Lord, till the day when I come up as a witness: for my purpose is to send for the nations and to get the kingdoms together, so that I may let loose on them my passion, even all my burning wrath: for all the earth will be burned up in the fire of my bitter passion.
<ASV> And she came in quickly to the king, and said, My desire is that you give me straight away on a plate the head of John the Baptist.
<ASV> And the sister of Tahpenes had a son by him, Genubath, whom Tahpenes took care of in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was living in Pharaoh's house among Pharaoh's sons.
<ASV> And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to him, Son, you have forgiveness for your sins.
<ASV> And the ravens took him bread in the morning and meat in the evening; and the water of the stream was his drink.
<ASV> And for this purpose I am working, using all my strength by the help of his power which is working in me strongly.
<ASV> Then his servants said to him, It is said that the kings of Israel are full of mercy: let us then put on haircloth, and cords on our heads, and go to the king of Israel; it may be that he will give you your life.
<ASV> And the food at his table, and all his servants seated there, and those who were waiting on him in their places, and their robes, and his wine-servants, and the burned offerings which he made in the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her.
<ASV> And so it is my purpose to make a house for the name of the Lord my God, as he said to David my father, Your son, whom I will make king in your place, will be the builder of a house for my name.
<ASV> The two of them were ten cubits high.
<ASV> Even so, when you see these things taking place, you may be certain that he is near, even at the doors.
<ASV> Send them away, so that they may go into the country and small towns round about, and get some food for themselves.
<ASV> And frequently it has sent him into the fire and into the water, for his destruction; but if you are able to do anything, have pity on us, and give us help.
<ASV> My men will take them down from Lebanon to the sea, where I will have them corded together to go by sea to whatever place you say, and I will have them cut up there so that you may take them away; as for payment, it will be enough if you give me food for my people.
<ASV> Before the Lord sends you violently away in flight like the waste from the grain; before the burning wrath of the Lord comes on you, before the day of the Lord's wrath comes on you.
<ASV> (And the stones used in the building of the house were squared at the place where they were cut out; there was no sound of hammer or axe or any iron instrument while they were building the house.)
<ASV> And the king of Israel went out and took the horses and the war-carriages, and made great destruction among the Aramaeans.
<ASV> But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the towns which Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.
<ASV> Now I have one request to make to you, and do not say, No, to me. And she said to him, Say on.
<ASV> And in the morning, a long time before daylight, he got up and went out to a quiet place, and there he gave himself up to prayer.
<ASV> When your people Israel are overcome in war, because of their sin against you; if they are turned to you again, honouring your name, making prayers to you and requesting your grace in this house:
<ASV> But he kept quiet and said nothing. Again the high priest questioning him said, Are you the Christ, the son of the Holy One?
<ASV> And twelve lions were placed on the one side and on the other side on the six steps: there was nothing like it in any kingdom.
<ASV> And they went out, preaching everywhere, the Lord working with them, and giving witness to the word by the signs which came after. So be it.
<ASV> And straight away the fountain of her blood was stopped, and she had a feeling in her body that her disease had gone and she was well.
<ASV> And they went straight from their nets, and came after him.
<ASV> I have had the nations cut off, their towers are broken down; I have made their streets a waste so that no one goes through them: destruction has overtaken their towns, so that there is no man living in them.
<ASV> And turning to them, he said to them in the form of a story, How is it possible for Satan to put out Satan?
<ASV> And the children of Israel got themselves together, and food was made ready and they went against them; the tents of the children of Israel were like two little flocks of goats before them, but all the country was full of the Aramaeans.
<ASV> And they gave him blows on the head with a stick and put shame on him and, going down on their knees, gave him worship.
<ASV> And he sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they put him on the king's beast:
<ASV> And as if copying the evil ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, was a small thing for him, he took as his wife Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of Zidon, and became a servant and worshipper of Baal.
<ASV> And his disciples said in answer, How will it be possible to get enough bread for these men here in a waste place?
<ASV> And without a story he said nothing to them: but privately to his disciples he made all things clear.
<ASV> He made sayings about all plants, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop hanging on the wall; and about all beasts and birds and fishes and the small things of the earth.
<ASV> He had seven hundred wives, daughters of kings, and three hundred other wives; and through his wives his heart was turned away.
<ASV> And while they were seated taking food, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, One of you will be false to me, one who is taking food with me.
<ASV> So Solomon and all Israel with him, a very great meeting, (for the people had come together from the way into Hamath to the river of Egypt,) kept the feast at that time before the Lord our God, for two weeks, even fourteen days.
<ASV> Now Ben-hadad, king of Aram, got all his army together, and thirty-two kings with him, and horses and carriages of war; he went up and made war on Samaria, shutting it in.
<ASV> Now King David was old and far on in years; and though they put covers over him, his body was cold.
<ASV> And went after the man of God, and came up with him while he was seated under an oak-tree. And he said to him, Are you the man of God who came from Judah? And he said, I am.
<ASV> But I will keep safe seven thousand in Israel, all those whose knees have not been bent to Baal, and whose mouths have given him no kisses.
<ASV> And he put the question, How much bread have you? And they said, Seven cakes.
<ASV> In that day it will be said to Jerusalem, Have no fear: O Zion, let not your hands be feeble.
<ASV> But I will still have among you a quiet and poor people, and they will put their faith in the name of the Lord.
<ASV> The high places, however, were not taken away: but still the heart of Asa was true to the Lord all his life.
<ASV> And he went away from them, and again got into the boat and went across to the other side.
<ASV> And Micaiah said, By the living Lord, whatever the Lord says to me I will say.
<ASV> Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for witness against Jesus so that they might put him to death; and they were unable to get any.
<ASV> And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of James, and Salome, got spices, so that they might come and put them on him.
<ASV> And Jesus said to them, You will all be turned away from me: for it is in the Writings, I will put the keeper of the sheep to death, and the sheep will be put to flight.
<ASV> And when they were going by in the morning, they saw the fig-tree dead from the roots.
<ASV> And a man of God came up and said to the king of Israel, The Lord says, Because the Aramaeans have said, The Lord is a god of the hills and not of the valleys; I will give all this great army into your hands, and you will see that I am the Lord.
<ASV> And now you say, Go and say to your Lord, Elijah is here; and he will put me to death.
<ASV> And he made them all be seated in groups on the green grass.
<ASV> And went running through all the country round about, and took on their beds those who were ill, to where it was said that he was.
<ASV> And there were women watching from a distance: among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome,
<ASV> So they went through all the country, covering it between them; Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another by himself.
<ASV> And he said to it, Let no man take fruit from you for ever. And his disciples took note of his words.
<ASV> The door to the lowest side rooms was in the right side of the house; and they went up by twisting steps into the middle rooms, and from the middle into the third.
<ASV> And his mother and brothers came and were outside, and sent for him, requesting to see him.
<ASV> And while they were taking food, he took bread, and after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to them, and said, Take it: this is my body.
<ASV> So the responsible men and the chiefs who were in authority in his town, did as Jezebel had said in the letter she sent them.
<ASV> So Ahab went up to have food and drink, while Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he went down on the earth, putting his face between his knees.
<ASV> So that all the peoples of the earth may see that the Lord is God, and there is no other.
<ASV> And he said to her, Because I was talking to Naboth the Jezreelite, and I said to him, Let me have your vine-garden for a price, or, if it is pleasing to you, I will give you another vine-garden for it: and he said, I will not give you my vine-garden.
<ASV> And seating himself, he made the twelve come to him; and he said to them, If any man has the desire to be first, he will be last of all and servant of all.
<ASV> After hearing of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have for all the saints,
<ASV> Happy are your wives, happy are these your servants whose place is ever before you, hearing your words of wisdom.
<ASV> And you, who in the past were cut off and at war with God in your minds through evil works, he has now made one
<ASV> And have put on the new man, which has become new in knowledge after the image of his maker;
<ASV> ... and Solomon was the builder of Gezer and Beth-horon the lower,
<ASV> But when the grain is ready, he quickly sends men to get it cut, because the time for cutting has come.
<ASV> And he said to them, Go into all the world, and give the good news to everyone.
<ASV> The poor you have ever with you, and whenever you have the desire you may do them good: but me you have not for ever.
<ASV> And he made strong prayers to him not to send them away out of the country.
<ASV> And let the peace of Christ be ruling in your hearts, as it was the purpose of God for you to be one body; and give praise to God at all times.
<ASV> Truly I say to you, Whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of God like a little child, will not come into it at all.
<ASV> And the worshippers of the army of heaven on the house-tops, and the Lord's worshippers who take oaths by Milcom,
<ASV> I, Paul, give you this word of love in my handwriting. Keep in memory that I am a prisoner. Grace be with you.
<ASV> And he said, I have been burning for the honour of the Lord, the God of armies; for the children of Israel have not kept your agreement; they have made destruction of your altars, and have put your prophets to death with the sword: till I, even I, am the only one living; and now they are attempting to take away my life.
<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
<ASV> And he came, and saw them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? were you not able to keep watch one hour?
<ASV> But the word of God came to Shemaiah, the man of God, saying,
<ASV> So all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had given orders, saying, Come back to me the third day.
<ASV> And Solomon, awakening, saw that it was a dream; then he came to Jerusalem, where he went before the ark of the agreement of the Lord, offering burned offerings and peace-offerings; and he made a feast for all his servants.
<ASV> But in those days, after that time of trouble, the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light,
<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
<ASV> And after he had sent them away, he went up into a mountain for prayer.
<ASV> Then Abijam went to rest with his fathers, and they put him into the earth in the town of David: and Asa his son became king in his place.
<ASV> There were six steps going up to it, and the top of it was round at the back, there were arms on the two sides of the seat, and two lions by the side of the arms;
<ASV> So that the Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.
<ASV> In the same way the chief priests, laughing at him among themselves with the scribes, said, A saviour of others, he has no salvation for himself.
<ASV> This will be their fate because of their pride, because they have said evil, lifting themselves up against the people of the Lord of armies.
<ASV> In whom are all the secret stores of wisdom and knowledge.
<ASV> And at the back of the house a further space of twenty cubits was shut in with boards of cedar-wood, for the inmost room.
<ASV> And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was taking food with the tax-farmers and sinners, said to his disciples, Why does he take food and drink with such men?
<ASV> In the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year that Solomon was king of Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, the building of the Lord's house was started.
<ASV> Then he said in answer, I have not been troubling Israel, but you and your family; because, turning away from the orders of the Lord, you have gone after the Baals.
<ASV> And some of those who were there said to them, What are you doing, taking the ass?
<ASV> And Elijah took the child down from his room into the house and gave him to his mother and said to her, See, your son is living.
<ASV> But a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having had news of him, came straight away and went down at his feet.
<ASV> And your servant has round him the people of your selection, a people so great that they may not be numbered, and no account of them may be given.
<ASV> But it is not so among you: but whoever has a desire to become great among you, let him be your servant:
<ASV> And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you come face to face with me, O my hater? And he said, I have come to you because you have given yourself up to do evil in the eyes of the Lord.
<ASV> And herds will take their rest in the middle of her, all the beasts of the valley: the pelican and the porcupine will make their living-places on the tops of its pillars; the owl will be crying in the window; the raven will be seen on the doorstep.
<ASV> Then put to death your bodies which are of the earth; wrong use of the flesh, unclean things, passion, evil desires and envy, which is the worship of strange gods;
<ASV> And Benaiah came to the Tent of the Lord and said to him, The king says, Come out. And he said, No; but let death come to me here. And Benaiah went back to the king and gave him word of the answer which Joab had given.
<ASV> And with him I have sent Onesimus, the true and well-loved brother, who is one of you. They will give you word of everything which is taking place here.
<ASV> The walls of the house were covered inside with cedar-wood boards; from the floor to the roof of the house they were covered inside with wood; and the floor was covered with boards of cypress-wood.
<ASV> Then Hiram sent to Solomon, saying; The words you sent have been given to me: I will do all your desire in the question of cedar-wood and cypress-wood.
<ASV> The crowns on the tops of the pillars were ornamented with a design of flowers, and were four cubits across.
<ASV> And they came to Jericho: and when he was going out of Jericho, with his disciples and a great number of people, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind man, was seated by the wayside, with his hand out for money.
<ASV> The seed is the word.
<ASV> Now when the priests had come out of the holy place, the house of the Lord was full of the cloud,
<ASV> And I will be ever among the children of Israel, and will not go away from my people.
<ASV> Their children who were still in the land, and whom the children of Israel had not been able to put to complete destruction, them did Solomon put to forced work, to this day.
<ASV> Then the mother of the living child came forward, for her heart went out to her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the child; do not on any account put it to death. But the other woman said, It will not be mine or yours; let it be cut in two.
<ASV> And he said to them, Truly, Elijah does come first, and puts all things in order; and how is it said in the Writings that the Son of man will go through much sorrow and be made as nothing?
<ASV> And they will make sport of him, and put shame on him, and give him cruel blows, and will put him to death; and after three days he will come back from the dead.
<ASV> And now Solomon is seated on the seat of the kingdom.
<ASV> So he put up the house and made it complete, roofing it with boards of cedar-wood.
<ASV> And these are they who were planted on the good earth; such as give ear to the word, and take it into their hearts, and give fruit, thirty and sixty and a hundred times as much.
<ASV> And there were about four thousand people: and he sent them away.
<ASV> And straight away all the people, when they saw him, were full of wonder, and running to him, gave him worship.
<ASV> Hearing these words, Ahab, in great grief, put haircloth on his flesh and went without food, sleeping in haircloth, and going about quietly.
<ASV> And going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in their boat stitching up their nets.
<ASV> And when they went in, they saw a young man seated on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were full of wonder.
<ASV> But take care: for they will give you up to the Sanhedrins; and in Synagogues you will be whipped; and you will be taken before rulers and kings because of me, for a sign to them.
<ASV> And when Jesus saw that the people came running together, he gave orders to the unclean spirit, saying to him, You, spirit, who are the cause of his loss of voice and hearing, I say to you, come out of him, and never again go into him.
<ASV> But I will take the kingdom from his son, and give it to you.
<ASV> Take care that no one takes you away by force, through man's wisdom and deceit, going after the beliefs of men and the theories of the world, and not after Christ:
<ASV> And all the people came up after him, piping with pipes, and they were glad with great joy, so that the earth was shaking with the sound.
<ASV> And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great number from Galilee came after him: and from Judaea,
<ASV> The house which Solomon made for the Lord was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.
<ASV> And Ahijah took his new robe in his hands, parting it violently into twelve.
<ASV> Keep yourself from death, and come down from the cross.
<ASV> Give ear in heaven your living-place, and give him his desire, whatever it may be; so that all the peoples of the earth may have knowledge of your name, worshipping you as do your people Israel, and that they may see that this house which I have put up is truly named by your name.
<ASV> And king Herod had news of him, because his name was on the lips of all; and he said, John the Baptist has come back from the dead, and for this reason these powers are working in him.
<ASV> And it came about that on the Sabbath day he was going through the grain-fields; and while they were walking, his disciples took the heads of grain.
<ASV> And he said to them, Have you no knowledge of what David did, when he had need and was without food, he, and those who were with him?
<ASV> And while you are still talking there with the king, see, I will come in after you and say that your story is true.
<ASV> And they came to Jerusalem; and he went into the Temple, and sent out those who were trading there, overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who were offering doves for money;
<ASV> For God in full measure was pleased to be in him;
<ASV> For this is the word of the Lord, the God of Israel: The store of meal will not come to an end, and the bottle will never be without oil, till the day when the Lord sends rain on the earth.
<ASV> And after a very little time, the heaven became black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab went in his carriage to Jezreel.
<ASV> Then Jezebel, hearing that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, said to Ahab, Get up and take as your heritage the vine-garden of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he would not give you for money, for Naboth is no longer living but is dead.
<ASV> And whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, the armed men went with him taking the body-covers, and then took them back to their room.
<ASV> Copying all the evil ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and all the sins he did and made Israel do, moving the Lord, the God of Israel, to wrath by their foolish ways.
<ASV> For the way into the inmost room he made doors of olive-wood, the arch and the door supports forming a five-sided opening.
<ASV> And straight away he made his disciples get into the boat, and go before him to the other side to Beth-saida, while he himself sent the people away.
<ASV> And he made a request to his disciples to have a little boat ready for him, so that he might not be crushed by the people;
<ASV> Ahinadab, the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
<ASV> Then he came across another man, and said, Give me a wound. And the man gave him a blow wounding him.
<ASV> And she went out and said to her mother, What is my request to be? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
<ASV> And four men came to him with one on a bed who had no power of moving.
<ASV> And he said, I have been burning for the honour of the Lord, the God of armies; for the children of Israel have not kept your agreement; they have had your altars broken down, and have put your prophets to death with the sword: till I, even I, am the only one living; and now they are attempting to take away my life.
<ASV> The weight of all these vessels was not measured, because there was such a number of them; it was not possible to get the weight of the brass.
<ASV> Now for three years there was no war between Aram and Israel.
<ASV> Let not that which has been joined together by God be parted by man.
<ASV> And he got up, and went into the country of Judaea on the other side of Jordan: and great numbers of people came together to him again; and, as was his way, he gave them teaching.
<ASV> Then he quickly took the head-band from his eyes; and the king of Israel saw that he was one of the prophets.
<ASV> Then I will have Israel cut off from the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for myself, I will put away from before my eyes; and Israel will be a public example, and a word of shame among all peoples.
<ASV> And if your eye is a cause of trouble to you, take it out: it is better for you to go into the kingdom of God with one eye than, having two eyes, to go into hell,
<ASV> And the altar was broken and the burned waste on it overturned; this was the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord.
<ASV> And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and the other side of Jordan, and the country about Tyre and Sidon, a great number, hearing what great things he did, came to him.
<ASV> That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and sorrow, a day of wasting and destruction, a day of dark night and deep shade, a day of cloud and thick dark.
<ASV> And they sent out a number of evil spirits, and put oil on a great number who were ill, and made them well.
<ASV> And Solomon, in his love for the Lord, kept the laws of David his father; but he made offerings and let them go up in smoke on the high places.
<ASV> And they gave Solomon word of it, saying, See, Adonijah goes in such fear of King Solomon, that he has put his hands on the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon first give me his oath that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.
<ASV> Then the prophet came up to the king of Israel, and said to him, Now make yourself strong, and take care what you do, or a year from now the king of Aram will come up against you again.
<ASV> Then a prophet came up to Ahab, king of Israel, and said, The Lord says, Have you seen all this great army? See, I will give it into your hands today, and you will see that I am the Lord.
<ASV> And all the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, the seventh month.
<ASV> And they took Jesus away to the high priest; and there came together with him all the chief priests and those in authority and the scribes.
<ASV> But Jesus said to them, You have no knowledge of what you are saying. Are you able to take of my cup? or to undergo the baptism which I am to undergo?
<ASV> For the outcry he made by the word of the Lord against the altar in Beth-el and against all the houses of the high places in the towns of Samaria, will certainly come about.
<ASV> And he said to them in answer, What did Moses say you were to do?
<ASV> At that time there was no king in Edom;
<ASV> And he did the same sins which his father had done before him: his heart was not completely true to the Lord his God, like the heart of David his father.
<ASV> In the future life, when they come back from the dead, whose wife will she be? for the seven had her for a wife.
<ASV> And news came to the people in the tents that Zimri had made a secret design and had put the king to death: so all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king that day in the tents.
<ASV> And news of this came to Joab; for Joab had been one of Adonijah's supporters, though he had not been on Absalom's side. Then Joab went in flight to the Tent of the Lord, and put his hands on the horns of the altar.
<ASV> And news was given to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come back again.
<ASV> The rods were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place, in front of the inmost room; but they were not seen from outside: and there they are to this day.
<ASV> And God said to him, Because your request is for this thing, and not for long life for yourself or for wealth or for the destruction of your haters, but for wisdom to be a judge of causes;
<ASV> And he said to them, When the light comes in, do people put it under a vessel, or under the bed, and not on its table?
<ASV> Heaven and earth will come to an end, but my words will not come to an end.
<ASV> And if you go on in my ways, keeping my laws and my orders as your father David did, I will give you a long life.
<ASV> So he got up and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the door of the town, he saw a widow woman getting sticks together; and crying out to her he said, Will you give me a little water in a vessel for my drink?
<ASV> And Micaiah said, If you come back at all in peace, the Lord has not sent his word by me.
<ASV> And now you say, Go, say to your lord, Elijah is here.
<ASV> I said, Certainly you will go in fear of me, and come under my training, so that whatever I may send on her may not be cut off before her eyes: but they got up early and made all their works evil.
<ASV> From over the rivers of Ethiopia, and from the sides of the north, they will come to me with an offering.
<ASV> And he went back, and took the oxen and put them to death, and cooking their flesh with the yokes of the oxen, he gave the people a feast. Then he got up and went after Elijah and became his servant.
<ASV> And saying, The time has come, and the kingdom of God is near: let your hearts be turned from sin and have faith in the good news.
<ASV> The two winged ones were ten cubits high, of the same size and form.
<ASV> But giving them the answer put forward by the young men, saying, My father made your yoke hard, but I will make it harder; my father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give it with snakes.
<ASV> (Hiram, king of Tyre, had given Solomon cedar-trees and cypress-trees and gold, as much as he had need of,) King Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the land of Galilee.
<ASV> All these buildings were made, inside and out, from base to crowning stone, and outside to the great walled square, of highly priced stone, cut to different sizes with cutting-instruments.
<ASV> And a great number had come together, so that there was no longer room for them, no, not even about the door: and he gave them teaching.
<ASV> Now when Hadad had news in Egypt that David had been put to rest with his fathers, and that Joab, the captain of the army, was dead, he said to Pharaoh, Send me back to my country.
<ASV> And King Solomon made a sea-force of ships in Ezion-geber, by Eloth, on the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
<ASV> And all the seven had no seed. Last of all the woman herself came to her death.
<ASV> Then Jezebel sent a servant to Elijah, saying, May the gods' punishment be on me if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.
<ASV> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth-gilead.
<ASV> So I will send evil on the line of Jeroboam, cutting off from his family every male child, those who are shut up and those who go free in Israel; the family of Jeroboam will be brushed away like a man brushing away waste till it is all gone.
<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
<ASV> The Lord in her is upright; he will not do evil; every morning he lets his righteousness be seen, he is unchanging; but the evil-doer has no sense of shame.
<ASV> And sent them to Lebanon in bands of ten thousand every month: for a month they were working in Lebanon and for two months in their country, and Adoniram was in control of them.
<ASV> And Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, was king in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he was king for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the town which the Lord had made his out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there; his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonite woman.
<ASV> For in those days there will be sorrow, such as there has not been from the time when God made the world till now, and will not ever be again.
<ASV> Then two loose women of the town came and took their places before the king;
<ASV> And taking her by the hand, he said to her, Talitha cumi, which is, My child, I say to you, Get up.
<ASV> Jesus said in answer, The first is, Give ear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord;
<ASV> He went up to the altar he had made in Beth-el on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the month fixed by him at his pleasure; and he gave orders for a feast for the people of Israel, and went up to the altar, and there he made the smoke of his offerings go up.
<ASV> And Shimei said to the king, Very well! as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. And for a long time Shimei went on living in Jerusalem.
<ASV> Truly, I say to you, This generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete.
<ASV> For the king had Tarshish-ships at sea with the ships of Hiram; once every three years the Tarshish-ships came with gold and silver and ivory and monkeys and peacocks.
<ASV> And Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, By the living Lord, the God of Israel, whose servant I am, there will be no dew or rain in these years, but only at my word.
<ASV> And King David said, Send for Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
<ASV> And he said to them, How much bread have you? go and see. And when they had seen, they said, Five cakes of bread and two fishes.
<ASV> And King Solomon and all the men of Israel who had come together there, were with him before the ark, making offerings of sheep and oxen more than might be numbered.
<ASV> As it was given to you by Epaphras, our well-loved helper, who is a true servant of Christ for us,
<ASV> Then he said to him, Because you have not given ear to the voice of the Lord, straight away when you have gone from me a lion will put you to death. And when he had gone, straight away a lion came rushing at him and put him to death.
<ASV> And they came to Ophir, where they got four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and took it back to King Solomon.
<ASV> Now the two armies kept their positions facing one another for seven days. And on the seventh day the fight was started; and the children of Israel put to the sword a hundred thousand Aramaean footmen in one day.
<ASV> And he went away from there, and came into his country; and his disciples went with him.
<ASV> Let your talk be with grace, mixed with salt, so that you may be able to give an answer to everyone.
<ASV> And a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction, and gave the king of Israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing; so he said to the driver of his war-carriage, Go to one side and take me away out of the army, for I am badly wounded.
<ASV> And Ahab, the son of Omri, did evil in the eyes of the Lord, even worse than all who went before him.
<ASV> He was a trouble to Israel all through the days of Solomon. And this is the damage Hadad did: he was cruel to Israel while he was ruler over Edom.
<ASV> Geber, the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan; and one overseer had authority over all the overseers who were in the land.
<ASV> People came from every nation to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had word of his wisdom.
<ASV> Whatever prayer or request for your grace is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, whatever his trouble may be, whose hands are stretched out to this house:
<ASV> And it will come about at that time, that I will go searching through Jerusalem with lights; and I will send punishment on the men who have become like wine stored over-long, who say to themselves, The Lord will not do good and will not do evil.
<ASV> In the twenty-sixth year that Asa was king of Judah, Elah, the son of Baasha, became king of Israel in Tirzah, and he was king for two years.
<ASV> The rest of Israel will do no evil and say no false words; the tongue of deceit will not be seen in their mouth: for they will take their food and their rest, and no one will be a cause of fear to them.
<ASV> And came back with the head on a plate, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.
<ASV> And if there is division in a house, that house will come to destruction;
<ASV> Say to him, The Lord says, Have you put a man to death and taken his heritage? Then say to him, The Lord says, In the place where dogs have been drinking the blood of Naboth, there will your blood become the drink of dogs.
<ASV> And whoever has a desire to be first among you, let him be servant of all.
<ASV> Then come up after him and he will come in and take his place on the seat of my kingdom; for he is to be king in my place, and I have given orders that he is to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
<ASV> Giving praise to the Father who has given us a part in the heritage of the saints in light;
<ASV> Then I will make the seat of your rule over Israel certain for ever, as I gave my word to David your father, saying, You will never be without a man to be king in Israel.
<ASV> And Jeroboam was king for twenty-two years, and was put to rest with his fathers, and Nadab his son became king in his place.
<ASV> And he went into a house. And the people came together again, so that they were not even able to take bread.
<ASV> And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a great store of spices and jewels: never again was such a wealth of spices seen as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.
<ASV> And Jesus said to them, I will put to you one question; give me an answer, and I will say by what authority I do these things.
<ASV> The lowest line of them being five cubits wide, the middle six cubits wide and the third seven cubits; for there was a space all round the outside walls of the house so that the boards supporting the rooms did not have to be fixed in the walls of the house.
<ASV> And again he came and saw them sleeping, because their eyes were very tired; and they had nothing to say in answer.
<ASV> So Israel was turned away from the family of David to this day.
<ASV> In his days Hiel made Jericho; he put its base in position at the price of Abiram, his oldest son, and he put its doors in place at the price of his youngest son Segub; even as the Lord had said by Joshua, the son of Nun.
<ASV> So Solomon let Abiathar be priest no longer, so that he might make the word of the Lord come true which he said about the sons of Eli in Shiloh.
<ASV> And say, It is the king's order that this man is to be put in prison and given prison food till I come again in peace.
<ASV> So after taking thought the king made two oxen of gold; and he said to the people, You have been going up to Jerusalem long enough; see! these are your gods, O Israel, who took you out of the land of Egypt.
<ASV> Because of which the wrath of God comes on those who go against his orders;
<ASV> Children, do the orders of your fathers and mothers in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord.
<ASV> And more than all, have love; the only way in which you may be completely joined together.
<ASV> Why then have you not kept the oath of the Lord and the order which I gave you?
<ASV> And Solomon put twelve overseers over all Israel, to be responsible for the stores needed for the king and those of his house; every man was responsible for one month in the year.
<ASV> And the king said, Let the living child be cut in two and one half given to one woman and one to the other.
<ASV> And on that day, when the evening had come, he said to them, Let us go over to the other side.
<ASV> And Jesus, whose other name is Justus; these are of the circumcision: they are my only brother-workers for the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort to me.
<ASV> And Jesus said to them, Will the friends of a newly-married man go without food while he is with them? as long as they have him with them they will not go without food.
<ASV> And these are they by the wayside, where the word is planted; and when they have given ear, the Evil One comes straight away and takes away the word which has been planted in them.
<ASV> Then Solomon said, O Lord, to the sun you have given the heaven for a living-place, but your living-place was not seen by men;
<ASV> Then the king said, One says, The living child is my son, and yours is the dead: and the other says, Not so; but your son is the dead one and mine is the living.
<ASV> And they said to King Solomon, Joab has gone in flight to the Tent of the Lord and is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, make an attack on him.
<ASV> And Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel had come together to make him king,
<ASV> And you have kept the word which you gave to your servant David, my father; with your mouth you said it and with your hand you have made it come true this day.
<ASV> And the king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedars like the sycamore-trees of the lowlands in number.
<ASV> And Ahab said to Naboth, Give me your vine-garden so that I may have it for a garden of sweet plants, for it is near my house; and let me give you a better vine-garden in exchange, or, if it seems good to you, let me give you its value in money.
<ASV> And he said to them, My soul is very sad, even to death: be here a little time, and keep watch.
<ASV> And they put two thieves on crosses with him, one on his right side, and one on his left.
<ASV> And the Lord gave ear to the voice of Elijah, and the child's spirit came into him again, and he came back to life.
<ASV> For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother, and be joined to his wife;
<ASV> And if your hand is a cause of trouble to you, let it be cut off; it is better for you to go into life with one hand than to have two hands and go into hell, into the eternal fire.
<ASV> But the rest went in flight to Aphek, into the town, where a wall came down on the twenty-seven thousand who were still living. And Ben-hadad went in flight into the town, into an inner room.
<ASV> And it was the third hour when they put him on the cross.
<ASV> But again he said it was not so. And after a little time, again those who were near said to Peter, Truly you are one of them; for you are a Galilaean.
<ASV> And he made three hundred smaller body-covers of hammered gold, with three pounds of gold in every cover: and the king put them in the house of the Woods of Lebanon.
<ASV> And they had some small fishes; and blessing them he had them put before the people in the same way.
<ASV> The secret which has been kept from all times and generations, but has now been made clear to his saints,
<ASV> And everyone took with him an offering, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and robes, and coats of metal, and spices, and horses, and beasts of transport, regularly year by year.
<ASV> Then let your hearts be without sin before the Lord our God, walking in his laws and keeping his orders as at this day.
<ASV> Any man of the family of Ahab who comes to his death in the town will become food for the dogs; and he who comes to his death in the open country will be food for the birds of the air.
<ASV> Whoever does God's pleasure, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
<ASV> He put an end to the rest of those who were used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods, all those who were still in the land in the time of his father Asa.
<ASV> He made them of liquid metal in the lowland of Jordan, at the way across the river, at Adama, between Succoth and Zarethan.
<ASV> And the statement of his crime was put in writing on the cross, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<ASV> (But Rehoboam was still king over those of the children of Israel who were living in the towns of Judah.)
<ASV> And then if any man says to you, See, here is Christ; or, See, there; have no faith in it:
<ASV> Then he said, Go out and take your place on the mountain before the Lord. Then the Lord went by, and mountains were parted by the force of a great wind, and rocks were broken before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind there was an earth-shock, but the Lord was not in the earth-shock.
<ASV> And he said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who himself gave his word to David my father, and with his strong hand has made his word come true, saying,
<ASV> And he said to his sons, Make ready the ass for me. And they did so.
<ASV> And King Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and he made an attack on him and put him to death.
<ASV> And he said, What sort of towns are these which you have given me, my brother? So they were named the land of Cabul, to this day.
<ASV> And a great number put down their clothing in the way; and others put down branches which they had taken from the fields.
<ASV> If your people go out to war against their attackers, by whatever way you may send them, if they make their prayer to the Lord, turning their faces to this town of yours and to this house which I have made for your name:
<ASV> But Jesus gave no more answers, so that Pilate was full of wonder.
<ASV> In the third year of the rule of Asa, king of Judah, Baasha put him to death, and became king in his place.
<ASV> And he took a little child, and put him in the middle of them; and taking him in his arms, he said to them,
<ASV> Because David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, and never in all his life went against his orders, but only in the question of Uriah the Hittite.
<ASV> (So that I may send trouble for this on the seed of David, but not for ever.)
<ASV> And the Pharisees said to him, Why are they doing what it is not right to do on the Sabbath?
<ASV> Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he was king for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
<ASV> The Lord will let himself be seen by them: for he will make all the gods of the earth feeble; and men will go down before him in worship, everyone from his place, even all the sea-lands of the nations.
<ASV> And Solomon took his place on the seat of David his father, and his kingdom was made safe and strong.
<ASV> And by the order of the Lord he made an outcry against the altar, saying, O altar, altar, the Lord has said, From the seed of David will come a child, named Josiah, and on you he will put to death the priests of the high places, who are burning offerings on you, and men's bones will be burned on you.
<ASV> And hearing what he said, they were glad, and gave him their word to make him a payment of money. And he took thought how he might best give him up to them.
<ASV> And with this I have given you what you made no request for: wealth and honour, so that no king was ever your equal.
<ASV> And Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? But their cry was the louder, To the cross!
<ASV> And again he went out from Tyre, and came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the country of Decapolis.
<ASV> And he said to him, Master, all these laws I have kept from the time when I was young.
<ASV> And you are complete in him, who is the head of all rule and authority:
<ASV> And it will come about in the day of the Lord's offering, that I will send punishment on the rulers and the king's sons and all who are clothed in robes from strange lands.
<ASV> And the Lord has made his word come true; for I have taken my father David's place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel, as the Lord gave his word; and I have made a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
<ASV> And whatever place will not take you in and will not give ear to you, when you go away, put off the dust from your feet as a witness against them.

<ASV> She gave no attention to the voice, she had no use for teaching, she put no faith in the Lord, she did not come near to her God.

<ASV> And when they come from the market-place, they take no food till their hands are washed; and a number of other orders there are, which have been handed down to them to keep--washings of cups and pots and brass vessels.

<ASV> He was the maker of three thousand wise sayings, and of songs to the number of a thousand and five.

<ASV> And straight away Jesus was conscious that power had gone out of him; and, turning to the people, he said, Who was touching my robe?

<ASV> And seeing that they had trouble in getting their boat through the water, because the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea; and he would have gone past them;
<ASV> And the chief priests said a number of things against him.
<ASV> Of which I became a servant by the purpose of God which was given to me for you, to give effect to the word of God,
<ASV> But while they were seated at the table, the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had taken him back;
<ASV> Now when Solomon came to the end of building the house of the Lord and the king's house, and all Solomon's desires, which he had in mind were effected;

<ASV> It is simpler for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a man of wealth to come into the kingdom of God.
<ASV> And he took him on one side from the people privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he put water from his mouth on the man's tongue with his finger;

<ASV> And they put a purple robe on him, and twisting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;
<ASV> And straight away when he became king, he sent destruction on all the offspring of Jeroboam; there was not one living person of all the family of Jeroboam whom he did not put to death, so the word of the Lord, which he said by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite, came about;
<ASV> And looking up, he said, I see men; I see them like trees, walking.
<ASV> Pharaoh, king of Egypt, came and took Gezer, burning it down and putting to death the Canaanites living in the town, and he gave it for a bride-offering to his daughter, Solomon's wife. ...
<ASV> So that they may give you worship all the days of their life in the land which you gave to our fathers.
<ASV> And Jesus, hearing it, said to them, Why are you reasoning among yourselves because you have no bread? do you still not see, and is it still not clear to you? are your hearts so hard?

<ASV> And there came a poor widow, and she put in two little bits of money, which make a farthing.
<ASV> (All the inside of the house was cedar-wood, ornamented with designs of buds and flowers; no stonework was to be seen inside.)
<ASV> And he said to them, Why are you full of fear? have you still no faith?
<ASV> So now, O Lord, the God of Israel, let your word to your servant David, my father, come true, when you said, You will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel before me, if only your children give attention to their ways, walking before me as you have done.
<ASV> But Jesus said, Say not so: for there is no man who will do a great work in my name, and be able at the same time to say evil of me.

<ASV> And he said to them, Have even you so little wisdom? Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside is not able to make him unclean,
<ASV> Because today he has gone down and has put to death oxen and fat beasts and sheep in great numbers, and has sent for all the king's sons to come to him, with the captains of the army and Abiathar the priest; and they are feasting before him and crying, Long life to King Adonijah!
<ASV> Even as it is said in the book of Isaiah the prophet, See, I send my servant before your face, who will make ready your way;

<ASV> And turning to the people again, he said to them, Give ear to me all of you, and let my words be clear to you:
<ASV> And these signs will be with those who have faith: in my name they will send out evil spirits; and they will make use of new languages;
<ASV> Let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father: see, I have sent you an offering of silver and gold; go and put an end to your agreement with Baasha, king of Israel, so that he may give up attacking me.
<ASV> And the house for his living-place, the other open square in the covered room, was made in the same way. And then he made a house like it for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had taken as his wife.
<ASV> Then Adonijah put to death sheep and oxen and fat beasts by the stone of Zoheleth, by En-rogel; and he sent for all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants, to come to him:

<ASV> And Adonijah himself was full of fear because of Solomon; and he got up and went to the altar, and put his hands on its horns.
<ASV> But there were certain of the scribes seated there, and reasoning in their hearts,
<ASV> And the men of the army took him away into the square in front of the building which is the Praetorium, and they got together all the band.
<ASV> And when she was going to get it, he said to her, And get me with it a small bit of bread.

<ASV> And when this letter has been made public among you, let the same be done in the church of Laodicea; and see that you have the letter from Laodicea.

<ASV> And while the words were on his lips, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, came; and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are a man of good faith and the news which you have for us will be good.

<ASV> And his clothing became shining, very white, as no cleaner on earth would make it.
<ASV> Then Elijah said to the people, I, even I, am the only living prophet of the Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
<ASV> Luke, our well-loved medical friend, and Demas, send you their love.
<ASV> Then King Solomon made answer and said to his mother, Why are you requesting me to give Abishag the Shunammite to Adonijah? Take the kingdom for him in addition, for he is my older brother, and Abiathar the priest and Joab, the son of Zeruiah, are on his side.
<ASV> Then Elijah said to Ahab, Up! take food and drink, for there is a sound of much rain.
<ASV> And the high priest, violently parting his robes, said, What more need have we of witnesses?
<ASV> And his disciples said to him, You see the people round you on every side, and you say, Who was touching me?
<ASV> And when I got up to give my child the breast, I saw that it was dead; but in the morning, looking at it with care, I saw that it was not my son.

<ASV> Come together, make everyone come together, O nation without shame;
<ASV> Now after John had been put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the good news of God,
<ASV> And when he was by himself, those who were round him with the twelve put questions to him about the purpose of the stories.
<ASV> And when the Sabbath day had come, he was teaching in the Synagogue; and a number of people hearing him were surprised, saying, From where did this man get these things? and, What is the wisdom given to this man, and what are these works of power done by his hands?
<ASV> And the supports for the lights, five on the right side and five on the left before the inmost room, of clear gold; and the flowers and the lights and all the instruments of gold;
<ASV> And Jesus questioning the father said, How long has he been like this? And he said, From a child.
<ASV> But all this time the people were making their offerings in the high places, because no house had been put up to the name of the Lord till those days.
<ASV> And when he had come, he went straight to him and said, Master; and gave him a kiss.
<ASV> Because they are turned away from me to the worship of Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and Chemosh, the god of Moab, and Milcom, the god of the Ammonites; they have not been walking in my ways or doing what is right in my eyes or keeping my laws and my decisions as his father David did.
<ASV> Then give ear in heaven, and let the sin of your people Israel have forgiveness, and take them back again into the land which you gave to their fathers.
<ASV> And he said to them, It is one of the twelve, one who is putting his bread with me into the same plate.
<ASV> But the man of God said to the king, Even if you gave me half of all you have, I would not go in with you, and I would not take food or a drink of water in this place;
<ASV> And wherever he goes in, say to the owner of the house, The Master says, Where is my guest-room, where I may take the Passover with my disciples?

<ASV> And he took an oath, saying to her, Whatever is your desire I will give it to you, even half of my kingdom.
<ASV> For a number gave false witness against him and their witness was not in agreement.
<ASV> And they took to him little children, so that he might put his hands on them: and the disciples said sharp words to them.
<ASV> And no man puts new wine into old wine-skins: or the skins will be burst by the wine, and the wine and the skins will be wasted: but new wine has to be put into new wine-skins.
<ASV> I will take away man and beast; I will take away the birds of the heaven and the fishes of the sea; causing the downfall of the evil-doers, and cutting man off from the face of the earth, says the Lord.
<ASV> And a leper came to him and, going down on his knees before him, made a request, saying, If it is your pleasure, you have the power to make me clean.
<ASV> The Son of man goes, even as the Writings say of him: but cursed is that man through whom the Son of man is given up! It would have been well for that man if he had never been given birth.
<ASV> So the prophet went away, and pulling his head-band over his eyes to keep his face covered, took his place by the road waiting for the king.
<ASV> Then Solomon, after making all these prayers and requests for grace to the Lord, got up from his knees before the altar of the Lord, where his hands had been stretched out in prayer to heaven;
<ASV> And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Beth-phage and Bethany, at the Mountain of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
<ASV> Answering with forgiveness the people who have done wrong against you, and overlooking the evil which they have done against you; let those who made them prisoners be moved with pity for them, and have pity on them;
<ASV> If you were made free, by your death with Christ, from the rules of the world, why do you put yourselves under the authority of orders
<ASV> Having been put to death with him in baptism, by which you came to life again with him, through faith in the working of God, who made him come back from the dead.
<ASV> And he made ready an inmost room in the middle of the house, in which to put the ark of the agreement of the Lord.
<ASV> Those used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods he sent out of the country, and he took away all the images which his fathers had made.
<ASV> But now it is right for you to put away all these things; wrath, passion, bad feeling, curses, unclean talk;
<ASV> Be wise in your behaviour to those who are outside, making good use of the time.
<ASV> It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is put in the earth, is smaller than all the seeds on the earth,
<ASV> And the high priest got up in the middle of them, and said to Jesus, Do you say nothing in answer? what is it which these say against you?
<ASV> And the Lord said to him, Your prayers and your requests for grace have come to my ears: I have made holy this house which you have made, and I have put my name there for ever; my eyes and my heart will be there at all times.
<ASV> Even their silver and their gold will not be able to keep them safe in the day of the Lord's wrath; but all the land will be burned up in the fire of his bitter wrath: for he will put an end, even suddenly, to all who are living in the land.
<ASV> And all the responsible men and the people said to him, Do not give attention to him or do what he says.
<ASV> But he got away unclothed, without the linen cloth.
<ASV> And he went on his way, and made public in the country of Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him: and all men were full of wonder.
<ASV> Then Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, said to Jehoshaphat, Let my men go with yours in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not let them.
<ASV> Then there was a division among the people of Israel; half the people were for making Tibni, son of Ginath, king, and half were supporting Omri.
<ASV> Then the king of Aram's servants said to him, Their god is a god of the hills; that is why they were stronger than we: but if we make an attack on them in the lowlands, we will certainly be stronger than they.
<ASV> Then he said, Get me a sword. So they went and put a sword before the king.
<ASV> Now the Lord had given Solomon wisdom, as he had said to him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they made an agreement together.
<ASV> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say that he would not be a prophet of good but of evil?
<ASV> Then the king said, May the God of Israel be praised, who has given one of my seed to be king in my place this day and has let my eyes see it.
<ASV> And he said to her, Let the children first have their food: for it is not right to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs.
<ASV> For you made them separate from all the peoples of the earth, to be your heritage, as you said by Moses your servant, when you took our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.
<ASV> And so he did for all his strange wives, who made offerings with burning of perfumes to their gods.
<ASV> But they said nothing: because they had had an argument between themselves on the way, about who was the greatest.
<ASV> And you Ethiopians will be put to death by my sword.
<ASV> Keep watch with prayer, so that you may not be put to the test; the spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is feeble.
<ASV> And when it was evening he came with the twelve.
<ASV> And he would not let Maacah his mother be queen, because she had made a disgusting image for Asherah; and Asa had the image cut down and burned by the stream Kidron.
<ASV> Then he said, I saw all Israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper; and the Lord said, These have no master: let them go back, every man to his house in peace.
<ASV> And Jesus gave a loud cry, and gave up his spirit.
<ASV> And at the ninth hour, Jesus said in a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, My God, my God, why are you turned away from me?
<ASV> Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram, the overseer of the forced work; and he was stoned to death by all Israel. And King Rehoboam went quickly and got into his carriage to go in flight to Jerusalem.
<ASV> And King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom.
<ASV> Now these words and Solomon's request were pleasing to the Lord.
<ASV> And he said to them, This is my blood of the testament, which is given for men.
<ASV> And a woman, who had had a flow of blood for twelve years,
<ASV> And John's disciples and the Pharisees were taking no food: and they came and said to him, Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees go without food, but your disciples do not?
<ASV> And they said to him, Send us into the pigs, so that we may go into them.
<ASV> And news of this decision which the king had made went through all Israel; and they had fear of the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to give decisions.
<ASV> And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and did a dance, Herod and those who were at table with him were pleased with her; and the king said to the girl, Make a request for anything and I will give it you.
<ASV> And, getting on his feet, he gave a blessing to all the men of Israel, saying with a loud voice,
<ASV> Jesus said to them, Is not this the reason for your error, that you have no knowledge of the holy Writings or of the power of God?
<ASV> Then the king sent for Shimei, and said to him, Make a house for yourself in Jerusalem and keep there and go to no other place.
<ASV> And now, see, the Lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and the Lord has said evil against you.
<ASV> Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did the work of cutting them, and put edges on them, and got the wood and the stone ready for the building of the house.
<ASV> Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was head of the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
<ASV> And a number, who were ill with different diseases, he made well, and sent out evil spirits; but he did not let the evil spirits say anything, because they had knowledge of him.
<ASV> And the Lord said, How may Ahab be tricked into going up to Ramoth-gilead to his death? And one said one thing and one another.
<ASV> And they put their hands on him, and took him.
<ASV> Now the king of Aram had given orders to the thirty-two captains of his war-carriages, saying, Make no attack on small or great, but only on the king of Israel.
<ASV> For, turning away from the law of God, you keep the rules of men.
<ASV> And what I say to you, I say to all, Keep watch.
<ASV> There were nets of open-work for the crowns on the tops of the pillars, a net of open-work for one and a net of open-work for the other.
<ASV> And when David had sent destruction on Edom, and Joab, the captain of the army, had gone to put the dead into the earth, and had put to death every male in Edom;
<ASV> And there came together to him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem,
<ASV> And they took him and put him to death, pushing his body out of the garden.
<ASV> Now the rest of the acts which Omri did, and his great power, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
<ASV> But you have done evil more than any before you, and have made for yourself other gods, and images of metal, moving me to wrath, and turning your back on me.
<ASV> And Baasha, hearing of it, put a stop to the building of Ramah, and was living in Tirzah.
<ASV> And I will send trouble on men so that they will go about like the blind, because they have done evil against the Lord: and their blood will be drained out like dust, and their strength like waste.

<ASV> And those who took of the bread were five thousand men.
<ASV> And when he saw Jesus from far off, he went quickly to him and gave him worship;
<ASV> And he sent him away, saying to him very sharply,
<ASV> And he said to them, Truly you put on one side the law of God, so that you may keep the rules which have been handed down to you.
<ASV> For the wrongdoer will have punishment for the wrong he has done, without respect for any man's position.
<ASV> And one of them said, O my lord, I and this woman are living in the same house; and I gave birth to a child by her side in the house.
<ASV> Then some got up and gave false witness against him, saying,
<ASV> Do not make false statements to one another; because you have put away the old man with all his doings,
<ASV> Then Jeroboam made the town of Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim a strong place, and was living there; and from there he went out and did the same to Penuel.
<ASV> But have come back, and have taken food and water in this place where he said you were to take no food or water; your dead body will not be put to rest with your fathers.
<ASV> And the king went to Gibeon to make an offering there, because that was the chief high place: it was Solomon's way to make a thousand burned offerings on that altar.
<ASV> Because he had frequently been prisoned in chains and iron bands, and the chains had been parted and the bands broken by him: and no man was strong enough to make him quiet.
<ASV> And in the middle of the day they went out. But Ben-hadad was drinking in the tents with the thirty-two kings who were helping him.
<ASV> David himself gives him the name of Lord; and how then is he his son? And the common people gave ear to him gladly.
<ASV> And after crying out and shaking him violently, it came out: and the child became like one dead; so that most of them said, He is dead.
<ASV> He took into the house of the Lord all the things which his father had made holy, and those which he himself had made holy, silver and gold and vessels.
<ASV> And when it was evening, because it was the time of getting ready, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
<ASV> These winged ones were plated over with gold.
<ASV> And he sent him away to his house, saying, Do not even go into the town.
<ASV> But his face became sad at the saying, and he went away sorrowing: for he was one who had much property.
<ASV> And Jesus came to a stop and said, Let him come. And crying out to the blind man, they said to him, Be comforted: come, he has sent for you.
<ASV> So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar-wood and cypress-wood he had need of;
<ASV> For the Lord said to me, You are not to take food or water there, or go back again by the way you came.
<ASV> And he said to them, Do not be troubled: you are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been put to death on the cross; he has come back from the dead; he is not here: see, the place where they put him!
<ASV> And Ben-hadad said to him, The towns my father took from your father I will give back; and you may make streets for yourself in Damascus as my father did in Samaria. And as for me, at the price of this agreement you will let me go. So he made an agreement with him and let him go.
<ASV> And not joined to the Head, from whom all the body, being given strength and kept together through its joins and bands, has its growth with the increase of God.
<ASV> And Baasha, the son of Ahijah, of the family of Issachar, made a secret design against him, attacking him at Gibbethon, a town of the Philistines; for Nadab and the armies of Israel were making war on Gibbethon.
<ASV> In the spaces of the flat sides and on the frames of them, he made designs of winged ones, lions, and palm-trees, with ornamented edges all round.
<ASV> But those workmen said among themselves, This is he who will one day be the owner of the property; come, let us put him to death, and the heritage will be ours.
<ASV> The covered way before the Temple of the house was twenty cubits long, as wide as the house, and ten cubits wide in front of the house.
<ASV> And he made the house of the Woods of Lebanon, which was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high, resting on four lines of cedar-wood pillars with cedar-wood supports on the pillars.
<ASV> Because he was not certain what to say, for they were in great fear.
<ASV> How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and took for food the holy bread, which only the priests may take, and gave it to those who were with him?
<ASV> But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet and Shimei and Rei, and David's men of war did not take the side of Adonijah.
<ASV> So, a year later, Ben-hadad got the Aramaeans together and went up to Aphek to make war on Israel.

<ASV> In the thirty-first year of Asa, king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel, and he was king for twelve years; for six years he was ruling in Tirzah.
<ASV> The way in which his hand came to be lifted up against the king was this: Solomon was building the Millo and making good the damaged parts of the town of his father David;
<ASV> And all the walls of the house inside and out were ornamented with forms of winged ones and palm-trees and open flowers.
<ASV> And Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you that you, today, even this night, before the cock's second cry, will say three times that you have no knowledge of me.
<ASV> And there were crowns on the two pillars near the round part by the network, and there were two hundred apples in lines round every crown.
<ASV> And this became a sin in the family of Jeroboam, causing it to be cut off and sent to destruction from the face of the earth.
<ASV> And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had made,
<ASV> And they were overcome with wonder, saying, He has done all things well: he even gives back the power of hearing and the power of talking to those who have been without them.
<ASV> And he got into the boat with his disciples straight away, and came into the country of Dalmanutha.
<ASV> He it was who made the two brass pillars; the first pillar was eighteen cubits high, and a line of twelve cubits went round it; and the second was the same.
<ASV> Peter said to him, See, we have given up everything, and come after you.
<ASV> So the servants of the chiefs of the divisions of the land went out of the town, with the army coming after them.
<ASV> And Simon and those who were with him came after him.
<ASV> And he took twelve to be with him, so that he might send them out as preachers,
<ASV> And, hearing of it, Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who was still in Egypt, where he had gone in flight from Solomon, and was living there, came back to his town Zeredah, in the hill-country of Ephraim;
<ASV> And these were his chief men: Azariah, the son of Zadok, was the priest;
<ASV> And they went away and gave news of it to the rest; and they had no belief in what was said.
<ASV> For this reason let no man be your judge in any question of food or drink or feast days or new moons or Sabbaths:
<ASV> And they all took of the food and had enough.
<ASV> Now, this was the way of Solomon's system of forced work for the building of the Lord's house and of the king's house, and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Megiddo and Gezer. ...
<ASV> And they said to him, If you will be a servant to this people today, caring for them and giving them a gentle answer, then they will be your servants for ever.
<ASV> And with the stones he made an altar to the name of the Lord; and he made a deep drain all round the altar, great enough to take two measures of seed.
<ASV> The land by the sea will be for the rest of the children of Judah; by the sea they will give their flocks food: in the houses of Ashkelon they will take their rest in the evening; for the Lord their God will take them in hand and their fate will be changed.
<ASV> Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, became king over Israel in the second year that Asa was king of Judah; and he was king of Israel for two years.
<ASV> And when the captains of the war-carriages saw that he was not the king of Israel, they went back from going after him.
<ASV> Solomon was thirteen years building a house for himself till it was complete.
<ASV> And John was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather band about him; and his food was locusts and honey.
<ASV> And Jesus said, I am: and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
<ASV> And when the captain, who was near, saw how he gave up his spirit, he said, Truly this man was a son of God.
<ASV> And he said, What picture may we give of the kingdom of God, or with what story may we make it clear?
<ASV> And this house will become a mass of broken walls, and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder at it and make whistling sounds; and they will say, Why has the Lord done so to this land and to this house?
<ASV> There was nothing in the ark but the two flat stones which Moses put there at Horeb, where the Lord made an agreement with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt.
<ASV> And when Jesus had gone over again in the boat to the other side, a great number of people came to him: and he was by the sea.
<ASV> The Lord has taken away those who were judging you, he has sent your haters far away: the King of Israel, even the Lord, is among you: you will have no more fear of evil.
<ASV> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will make a change in my clothing, so that I do not seem to be the king, and will go into the fight; but do you put on your robes. So the king of Israel made a change in his dress and went into the fight.
<ASV> Judah and Israel were as great in number as the sand by the seaside, and they took their food and drink with joy in their hearts.

<ASV> And they came to Capernaum; and on the Sabbath he went into the Synagogue and gave teaching.

<ASV> And there was war between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, all their days.
<ASV> And he said to them, Truly I say to you, There are some here who will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of God come with power.
<ASV> And he said to them, To you is given the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are given in the form of stories;
<ASV> And it came about that he was seated at meat in his house, and a number of tax-farmers and sinners were at table with Jesus and his disciples: for there were a great number of them, and they came after him.
<ASV> They will take up snakes, and if there is poison in their drink, it will do them no evil; they will put their hands on those who are ill, and they will get well.

<ASV> And he said to them, Let us go to other parts into the nearest towns, so that I may give teaching there, because for this purpose I came.

<ASV> Then the prophet who had made him come back, hearing it, said, It is the man of God, who went against the word of the Lord; that is why the Lord has given him to the lion to be wounded to death, as the Lord said.
<ASV> And he said, That which comes out of the man, that makes the man unclean.
<ASV> Everyone will be salted with fire.
<ASV> But take care; see, I have made all things clear to you before the time.
<ASV> Those of the family of Jeroboam who come to death in the town, will become food for the dogs; and those on whom death comes in the open country, will be food for the birds of the air; for the Lord has said it.
<ASV> And against the walls all round, and against the walls of the Temple and of the inmost room, he put up wings, with side rooms all round:
<ASV> A day of sounding the horn and the war-cry against the walled towns and the high towers.
<ASV> So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down and put Solomon on King David's beast and took him to Gihon.
<ASV> So that their hearts may be comforted, and that being joined together in love, they may come to the full wealth of the certain knowledge of the secret of God, even Christ,

<ASV> And he gave them special orders not to say who he was.
<ASV> And he went to them into the boat, and the wind went down, and they were full of wonder in themselves;
<ASV> And he made ten brass washing-vessels, everyone taking forty baths, and measuring four cubits; one vessel was placed on every one of the ten bases.
<ASV> Now it was in the heart of David my father to put up a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
<ASV> And one of the rulers of the Synagogue, Jairus by name, came, and seeing him, went down at his feet,
<ASV> Whoever has a feeling of shame because of me and my words in this false and evil generation, the Son of man will have a feeling of shame because of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
<ASV> And Jesus said to them, A prophet is nowhere without honour, but in his country, and among his relations, and in his family.
<ASV> And he said, Do it a third time, and they did it a third time.
<ASV> People will come in my name, saying, I am he; and a number will be turned from the true way.
<ASV> And he, putting off his coat, got up quickly, and came to Jesus.
<ASV> And the unclean spirit, shaking him violently, and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.
<ASV> So she went and did as Elijah said; and she and he and her family had food for a long time.
<ASV> Sorrow to the people living by the sea, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of the Lord is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will send destruction on you till there is no one living in you.
<ASV> And in the letter she said, Let a time of public sorrow be fixed, and put Naboth at the head of the people;

<ASV> And when they had made sport of him, they took the purple robe off him and put his clothing on him. And they took him out to put him to death on the cross.
<ASV> And they went away and saw a young ass by the door outside in the open street; and they were getting him loose.
<ASV> Having put an end to the handwriting of the law which was against us, taking it out of the way by nailing it to his cross;
<ASV> And there was one named Barabbas, in prison with those who had gone against the government and in the fight had taken life.

<ASV> And he put one in Beth-el and the other in Dan.
<ASV> And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, seated at table, there came a woman with a bottle of perfumed oil of great price; and when the bottle was broken she put the perfume on his head.
<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the secret design he made, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
<ASV> Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Let us now get directions from the Lord.
<ASV> And Solomon's horses came from Egypt and from Kue; the king's traders got them at a price from Kue.
<ASV> (There was no one like Ahab, who gave himself up to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, moved to it by Jezebel his wife.
<ASV> So Solomon made the building of the house complete.)
