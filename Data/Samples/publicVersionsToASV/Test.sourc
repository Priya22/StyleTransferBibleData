<ASV> And more than this, before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was making the offering, Give me some of the flesh to be cooked for the priest; he has no taste for meat cooked in water, but would have you give it uncooked.
<ASV> And Saul and all Israel, hearing those words of the Philistine, were troubled and full of fear.
<ASV> And they pass over, and go on, and the sun goeth in upon them near Gibeah, which is to Benjamin;
<ASV> Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.
<ASV> Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him a captain over a thousand men, and he went out and came in before the people.
<ASV> David replied, "What have I done now? I merely asked a question!
<ASV> sometimes being publicly exposed both to insults and to afflictions, and sometimes becoming sharers with those who were treated in this way.
<ASV> When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.
<ASV> And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.
<ASV> And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.
<ASV> Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.
<ASV> He said to him, "We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim. I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem Judah. I am going to Yahweh's house; and there is no one who has taken me into his house.
<ASV> And the Lord gave them up into the hands of Jabin, king of Canaan, who was ruling in Hazor; the captain of his army was Sisera, who was living in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
<ASV> But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.
<ASV> There remains then a sabbatism to the people of God.
<ASV> Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.
<ASV> The raiders went out from the camp of the Philistines in three divisions. One division turned on the road to Ophrah toward the land of Shual.
<ASV> And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
<ASV> And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life:
<ASV> And when he came, Eli was seated by the wayside watching: and in his heart was fear for the ark of God. And when the man came into the town and gave the news, there was a great outcry.
<ASV> War came again, so David went out and fought against the Philistines and defeated them thoroughly so that they fled before him.
<ASV> We made an attack on the south part of the country of the Cherethites, and on the land which is Judah's, and on the south of Caleb; and we put Ziklag on fire.
<ASV> Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
<ASV> Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith he) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount.
<ASV> And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?
<ASV> And inasmuch as it is not without an oath, (for the others indeed were made priests without an oath;
<ASV> And Saul said: No man shall be killed this day, because the Lord this day hath wrought salvation in Israel:
<ASV> In those days, when there was no king in Israel, there was a certain Levite living on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took for himself a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah.
<ASV> Will the rulers of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O Yahweh, God of Israel, please tell your servant!" And Yahweh said, "He will come down."
<ASV> Therefore,' declares Yahweh the God of Israel, 'though I solemnly said that your house and the house of your ancestor would walk before me forever, but now,' declares Yahweh, 'far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me, I will treat with contempt!
<ASV> and the Philistine looketh attentively, and seeth David, and despiseth him, for he was a youth, and ruddy, with a fair appearance.
<ASV> The king sat at his seat as before, the seat by the wall, and Jonathan got up, and Abner sat beside Saul, but David's place was empty.
<ASV> But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
<ASV> And she said, O my lord, as your soul is living, my lord, I am that woman who was making a prayer to the Lord here by your side:
<ASV> And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
<ASV> for also in Thessalonica once and even twice ye sent to me for my need.
<ASV> and, so fearful was the sight, Moses said, I am exceedingly afraid and full of trembling;)
<ASV> When David realized that Saul had gone out to seek his life, David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.
<ASV> And it came to pass the next day, that the Philistines came to strip the slain, and they found Saul and his three sons fallen on mount Gilboa.
<ASV> And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
<ASV> Behold, all ye, children of Israel, deliberate and give here  counsel.
<ASV> They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
<ASV> Grace be with you all. Amen.
<ASV> The men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar.
<ASV> The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.
<ASV> Now Anna spoke in her heart, and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard at all. Heli therefore thought her to be drunk,
<ASV> And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?
<ASV> And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gabaa under the pomegranate tree, which was in Magron: and the people with him were about six hundred men.
<ASV> For to go against his orders is like the sin of those who make use of secret arts, and pride is like giving worship to images. Because you have put away from you the word of the Lord, he has put you from your place as king.
<ASV> Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord all the days of his life, he shall be lent to the Lord. And they adored the Lord there. And Anna prayed, and said:
<ASV> But when Jesus had made one offering for sins for ever, he took his place at the right hand of God;
<ASV> But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels,
<ASV> Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
<ASV> The men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said to Jephthah, "Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didn't call us to go with you? We will burn your house around you with fire!"
<ASV> Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that may abound to your account.
<ASV> And at that time, when Eli was resting in his place, (now his eyes were becoming clouded so that he was not able to see,)
<ASV> You will see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I will give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.
<ASV> And the words, Still one more, make it clear that there will be a taking away of those things which are shaking, as of things which are made, so that there may be only those things of which no shaking is possible.
<ASV> Be nothing solicitous; but in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.
<ASV> just as also in another place he says, "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek,"
<ASV> And he took his army, and divided it into three companies, and laid ambushes in the fields. And seeing that the people came out of the city, he arose and set upon them,
<ASV> And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-Berith, and Abimelech hired with them vain and wanton men, and they followed him.
<ASV> Be mindful of those leading you, who did speak to you the word of God, whose faith -- considering the issue of the behaviour -- be imitating,
<ASV> Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
<ASV> And Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony to the things that would be spoken,
<ASV> And Yahweh said to him, "But I will be with you, and you will defeat Midian as if they are one man."
<ASV> And he said to the men of Succoth, Give bread cakes to my people, for they are overcome with weariness, and I am going on after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.
<ASV> And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the Lord; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.
<ASV> who being  effulgence of his glory and  expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having made [by himself] the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high,
<ASV> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
<ASV> Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the Lord in Mizpeh.
<ASV> The descendants of Benjamin went out to meet the troops, and they lured them away from the city and began to inflict casualties on the troops as before, on the main road, one of which goes up to Bethel, the other to Gibeah; and in the field there were about thirty men of Israel.
<ASV> And the Philistines fought, and Israel was routed, and they fled every man to his tent; and there was a very great slaughter, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
<ASV> And Samuel said: As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed him in pieces before the Lord in Galgal.
<ASV> But we cannot give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to the Benjaminites!
<ASV> But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
<ASV> And in the same way do you be glad and have a part in my joy.
<ASV> And Jehovah saith unto Samuel, `Till when art thou mourning for Saul, and I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I send thee unto Jesse the Beth-Lehemite, for I have seen among his sons for Myself a king.
<ASV> For Jehovah will not cast away his people for his great name's sake; because it has pleased Jehovah to make you his people.
<ASV> for your partnership in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;
<ASV> The servants of Achish said to him, "Is not this David the king of the land? Is it not for this one that they sang in the dances, saying, 'Saul killed his thousands, but David his ten thousands?'"
<ASV> who serve a sketch and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned when he was about to complete the tabernacle, for he says, "See to it that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain."
<ASV> When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to a silversmith, who made an engraved image and a molten image out of it. It was in the house of Micah.
<ASV> So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck; for the men of Israel yielded to Benjamin, because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.
<ASV> Saul became very angry, and this saying displeased him, and he thought, "They have attributed to David ten thousands, but to me they have attributed thousands! What more can he have but the kingdom?"
<ASV> Then David went to the other side and stood on the top of the hill at a distance; the distance was great between them.
<ASV> not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in  day of my taking their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because *they* did not continue in my covenant, and *I* did not regard them, saith  Lord.
<ASV> The Gazites were told, "Samson has come here," so they surrounded the place and lay in ambush for him all night at the city gate. They kept silent all night, saying, "We will wait until the morning light, and then we will kill him."
<ASV> And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness [of it]; for after what was said:
<ASV> But you know his proven character, that like a child with a father he served with me for the gospel.
<ASV> And the family of Joseph went up against Beth-el, and the Lord was with them.
<ASV> The word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
<ASV> Then the responsible men of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days, so that we may send men to every part of Israel: and then, if no one comes to our help, we will come out to you.
<ASV> Have moreover tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
<ASV> And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.
<ASV> Therefore they said: Who is thereof all the tribes of Israel, that came not up to the Lord to Maspha. And behold the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad were found not to have been in that army.
<ASV> If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
<ASV> So Saul said to his servant, "Your suggestion is a good one. Come, let us go." And they went to the town where the man of God was.
<ASV> Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no restraint on Yahweh to save by many or by few."
<ASV> They said to him, "Behold, you are old, and your sons don't walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations."
<ASV> nor did they show favor to the house of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) in accordance with all the good that he did for Israel.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Samuel: How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, whom I have rejected from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and come, that I may send thee to Isai the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
<ASV> And taking up the mouth-bone of an ass newly dead, which he saw by chance on the earth, he put to death a thousand men with it.
<ASV> And Gaal, the son of Ebed, went out, and took his place at the doorway into the town; then Abimelech and his people got up from the place where they had been waiting.
<ASV> The Philistines were afraid, for they said, "God has come into the camp." They said, "Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before.
<ASV> For if that first was faultless, place had not been sought for a second.
<ASV> And Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang on that day:
<ASV> Salute all your leaders, and all the saints. They from Italy salute you.
<ASV> Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him.
<ASV> If a man comes across his hater, will he let him get away safe? so may you be rewarded by the Lord for what you have done for me today.
<ASV> And the Philistines came together to make war on Israel, three thousand war-carriages and six thousand horsemen and an army of people like the sands of the sea in number: they came up and took up their position in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven.
<ASV> And David girded his sword above his long robe, and beginneth to go, for he hath not tried ; and David saith unto Saul, `I am not able to go with these, for I had not tried;' and David turneth them aside from off him.
<ASV> So Samuel went back after Saul, and Saul gave worship to the Lord.
<ASV> I exhort Euodia, and exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in  Lord;
<ASV> Now Saul came from the field, driving the oxen before him; and he said, Why are the people weeping? And they gave him word of what the men of Jabesh had said.
<ASV> `Also now, station yourselves and see this great thing which Jehovah is doing before your eyes;
<ASV> For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.
<ASV> And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.
<ASV> And the men of Azotus seeing this kind of plague, said: The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us: for his hand is heavy upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
<ASV> Doing nothing through envy or through pride, but with low thoughts of self let everyone take others to be better than himself;
<ASV> But this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by the decision of the Lord;
<ASV> Do not increase speaking very proud words! Let no arrogance go forth from your mouth, for Yahweh is a God of knowledge whose deeds are not weighed.
<ASV> And Saul discerneth the voice of David, and saith, `Is this thy voice, my son David?' and David saith, `My voice, my lord, O king!'
<ASV> And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
<ASV> And they struck Moab at that time, about ten thousand men, all strong and able men; no one escaped.
<ASV> for if that first were faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second.
<ASV> Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and the army went with him, whose hearts God had touched.
<ASV> After this he loved a woman, who dwelt in the valley of Sorec, and she was called Dalila.
<ASV> And said: Here am I: for thou didst call me. Then Heli understood that the Lord called the child, and he said to Samuel: Go, and sleep: and if he shall call thee any more, thou shalt say: Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and slept in his place.
<ASV> The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, "Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am avenged of my enemies." So none of the people tasted food.
<ASV> He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.
<ASV> When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, "What does the noise of this tumult mean?" The man hurried, and came and told Eli.
<ASV> `Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the masters of Shechem, Which  good for you -- the ruling over you of seventy men (all the sons of Jerubbaal), or the ruling over you of one man? -- and ye have remembered that I  your bone and your flesh.'
<ASV> And Jehovah will also give Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me; the army of Israel also will Jehovah give into the hand of the Philistines.
<ASV> For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside of the camp.
<ASV> The people said to Saul, "Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God today!" So the people rescued Jonathan, that he didn't die.
<ASV> Please don't let my lord pay attention to this worthless fellow, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your servant, didn't see my lord's young men, whom you sent.
<ASV> And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.
<ASV> The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.
<ASV> For they truly gave us punishment for a short time, as it seemed good to them; but he does it for our profit, so that we may become holy as he is.
<ASV> And just as it is destined for people to die once, and after this, judgment,
<ASV> And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
<ASV> You must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that are ravaging the land, and you must give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand on you and on your gods and on your land.
<ASV> And his mother's relatives spoke all these words concerning him to all the lords of Shechem; and they supported Abimelech, for they said, "He is our relative."
<ASV> And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, who had seen all the great works of Jehovah, which he had done for Israel.
<ASV> Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
<ASV> And after him came Jair the Gileadite, who was judge over Israel for twenty-two years.
<ASV> And Barak said to her, If thou goest with me, then I will go, but if thou goest not with me, I will not go.
<ASV> The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh's sight: and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
<ASV> But Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hears, he will kill me." Yahweh said, "You must take a heifer from the herd with you, and you must say, 'I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.'
<ASV> You made him a little lower than the angels; you gave him a crown of glory and honour, and made him ruler over all the works of your hands:
<ASV> So they smote that day the Philistines from Machmas to Ailon. And the people were wearied exceedingly.
<ASV> By whom this poor body of ours will be changed into the image of the body of his glory, in the measure of the working by which he is able to put all things under himself.
<ASV> And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah. Hallow yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he hallowed Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
<ASV> Jonathan therefore gave his arms to the boy, and said to him: Go, and carry them into the city.
<ASV> So then, my beloved and greatly desired brothers, my joy and crown, thus stand firm in the Lord, dear friends.
<ASV> Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and the earthly sanctuary.
<ASV> she shall not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither shall she drink wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean: all that I commanded her shall she observe.
<ASV> "The kings came, they fought; then the kings of Canaan fought; at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, they got no plunder in silver.
<ASV> But Barak went after the war-carriages and the army as far as Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all Sisera's army was put to the sword; not a man got away.
<ASV> So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.
<ASV> It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things should be cleansed with these: but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
<ASV> So then, please proclaim in the hearing of the troops, saying, 'Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from the Mount of Gilead.'" About twenty-two thousand troops returned, and ten thousand remained.
<ASV> And David said to Abisai: Kill him not: for who shall put forth his hand against the Lord's anointed, and shall be guiltless?
<ASV> And while Samuel was offering the burned offering, the Philistines came near for the attack on Israel; but at the thunder of the Lord's voice that day the Philistines were overcome with fear, and they gave way before Israel.
<ASV> By faith Abraham made an offering of Isaac, when he was tested: and he with whom the agreement had been made gave up as an offering the only son of his body,
<ASV> And David said, The Lord, who kept me safe from the grip of the lion and the bear, will be my saviour from the hands of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go! and may the Lord be with you.
<ASV> And a man of Benjamin went running from the fight and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothing out of order and earth on his head.
<ASV> For as to our own daughters we cannot give them, being bound with an oath and a curse, whereby we said: Cursed be he that shall give Benjamin any of his daughters to wife.
<ASV> For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens.
<ASV> And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me.
<ASV> The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.
<ASV> And Jehovah saith, `Judah doth go up; lo, I have given the land into his hand.'
<ASV> But the olive-tree said to them, Am I to give up my wealth of oil, by which men give honour to God, and go waving over the trees?
<ASV> Furthermore I count all things to be but loss for the excellent knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but as dung, that I may gain Christ:
<ASV> Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep.
<ASV> And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:
<ASV> The princes of Soccoth answered: Peradventure the palms of the hands of Zebee and Salmana are in thy hand, and therefore thou demandest that we should give bread to thy army.
<ASV> Now the Philistines had taken God's ark, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
<ASV> Judah captured Gaza and its territory, Ashkelon and its territory, and Ekron and its territory.
<ASV> Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
<ASV> Being given circumcision on the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in relation to the law, a Pharisee:
<ASV> Then Samuel gave him an account of everything, keeping nothing back. And he said, It is the Lord; let him do what seems good to him.
<ASV> And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you into our hands.
<ASV> Then Benjamin came back; and they gave them the women whom they had kept from death among the women of Jabesh-gilead: but still there were not enough for them.
<ASV> Brothers, I don't regard myself as yet having taken hold, but one thing I do. Forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,
<ASV> And the women sung as they played, and they said: I Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
<ASV> I give thanks to my God upon my every remembrance of you,
<ASV> And the children of Israel said to Jehovah, We have sinned. Do thou unto us according to all that is good in thy sight; only deliver us, we pray thee, this day.
<ASV> And David girded his sword upon his dress, and endeavoured to go; for he had not yet tried . And David said to Saul, I cannot go in these; for I have never tried . And David put them off him.
<ASV> And Gideon cometh in unto the Jordan, passing over, he and the three hundred men who  with him -- wearied, and pursuing,
<ASV> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this one.
<ASV> And whenever the evil spirit from God came on Saul, David took his instrument and made music: so new life came to Saul, and he got well, and the evil spirit went away from him.
<ASV> So do not give up your hope which will be greatly rewarded.
<ASV> And Abimelech abideth in Arumah, and Zebul casteth out Gaal and his brethren from dwelling in Shechem.
<ASV> And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And Jehovah said to David, Go and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
<ASV> And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few.
<ASV> Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. When they attacked Ziklag, they burned it with fire.
<ASV> And the youth cometh unto the place of the arrow which Jonathan hath shot, and Jonathan calleth after the youth, and saith, `Is not the arrow beyond thee?'
<ASV> And he saith to his youth, `Run, find, I pray thee, the arrows which I am shooting;' the youth is running, and he hath shot the arrow, causing  to pass over him.
<ASV> and they say unto Jephthah, `Come, and thou hast been to us for captain, and we fight against the Bene-Ammon.'
<ASV> Then the five men that had gone to spy out the country of Laish spoke and said to their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? And now ye know what to do.
<ASV> And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him exceedingly, and made him his armourbearer.

<ASV> And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.

<ASV> Then David got up and came to the place where Saul had encamped, and David saw the place where Saul was lying down, as well as Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. (Now Saul was lying in the encampment, and the army was encamping around him.)
<ASV> Samson said to them, "This time I will be blameless in the case of the Philistines, when I harm them."
<ASV> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.

<ASV> "So let all your enemies perish, Yahweh, but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises in its strength." Then the land had rest forty years.

<ASV> And Jonathan swore again to David, because he loved him: for he loved him as his own soul.
<ASV> For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.
<ASV> for we have known Him who is saying, `Vengeance  Mine, I will recompense, saith the Lord;' and again, `The Lord shall judge His people;' --
<ASV> They took the ark of God into the house of Dagon and put it by the side of Dagon.

<ASV> And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
<ASV> Did I take him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest and to go up to my altar to make the smoke of the offerings go up and to take up the ephod? Did I give to your father's family all the offerings made by fire by the children of Israel?
<ASV> And it answered them: Can I leave my sweetness, and my delicious fruits, and go to be promoted among the other trees?
<ASV> And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
<ASV> I have known both to be abased, and I have known to abound; in everything and in all things I have been initiated, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.
<ASV> He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
<ASV> For think diligently upon him that endured such opposition from sinners against himself; that you be not wearied, fainting in your minds.
<ASV> For this is the covenant that I will decree with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I am putting my laws in their minds and I will write them on their hearts, and I will be their God and they will be my people.
<ASV> Go therefore, I pray you, and use all diligence, and curiously inquire, and consider the place where his foot is, and who hath seen him there: for he thinketh of me, that I lie craftily in wait for him.

<ASV> And the spirit of the Lord began to be with him in the camp of Dan, between Saraa and Esthaol.
<ASV> And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
<ASV> And he consulted the Lord, and he answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by priests, nor by prophets.
<ASV> And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
<ASV> And it came to pass the next day that Saul set the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote Ammon until the heat of the day: and it came to pass that they who remained were scattered, and not two of them were left together.
<ASV> Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.

<ASV> and he saith unto them, `What have I done now like you? are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the harvest of Abi-Ezer?
<ASV> For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore Jehovah reward thee good for that thou hast done to me this day.
<ASV> And the spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to Ascalon, and slew there thirty men, whose garments he took away and gave to them that had declared the riddle. And being exceeding angry he went up to his father's house:
<ASV> And Gideon said to them, "Let me make a request of you, that each of you give to me an ornamental ring from his plunder." (They had ornamental rings of gold, because they were Ishmaelites.)
<ASV> And they all came to the house of God in Silo, and abiding before him till the evening, lifted up their voices, and began to lament and weep, saying:
<ASV> And all [they of] the land have come into a forest, and there is honey on the face of the field;
<ASV> For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
<ASV> You have not come to a mountain which may be touched, and is burning with fire, and to a black cloud, and a dark smoke, and a violent wind,
<ASV> Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
<ASV> Stay with me. Don't be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life. For you will be safe with me."
<ASV> Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
<ASV> When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
<ASV> Bent at her feet he went down, he was stretched out; bent at her feet he went down; where he was bent down, there he went down in death.

<ASV> Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman that has a spirit of Python, that I may go to her and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has a spirit of Python at En-dor.

<ASV> and Saul saith to the bearer of his weapons, `Draw thy sword, and pierce me with it, lest they come -- these uncircumcised -- and have pierced me, and rolled themselves on me;' and the bearer of his weapons hath not been willing, for he is greatly afraid, and Saul taketh the sword, and falleth upon it.
<ASV> And the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, and said, Is not David waiting secretly near us in the hill of Hachilah, before the waste land?

<ASV> And Saul said to him, Young man, whose son are you? And David in answer said, I am the son of your servant Jesse of Beth-lehem.
<ASV> It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the Lord all night.
<ASV> And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
<ASV> For the Lord will not give his people up, because of the honour of his name; for it was the Lord's pleasure to make of you a people for himself.
<ASV> The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish.
<ASV> After a while, at the time of the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat. He said, "I want to go to my wife's private room." But her father would not allow him to enter.

<ASV> But David's men said to him, "Look, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more if we go to Keilah to the battle lines of the Philistines?"
<ASV> Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.
<ASV> Then David said to Achish, "But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant from the day that I entered your service until this day, that I should not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"

<ASV> but to what we have come -- by the same rule walk, the same thing think;

<ASV> And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.
<ASV> Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob. Outlaws joined up with Jephthah, and they went out with him.

<ASV> But after Gedeon was dead, the children of Israel turned again, and committed fornication with Baalim. And they made a covenant with Baal, that he should be their god:
<ASV> And he knew not at all what was doing: for only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
<ASV> for the daughters of Israel to go and lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for forty days of the year.

<ASV> But the men were very good to us, and we were not harmed, and we didn't miss anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields.

<ASV> And the woman came at the dawning of the day, and fell down at the entrance of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.
<ASV> Jonathan got up from the table enraged, and did not eat on the second day of the new moon because he was upset about David, because his father had disgraced him.
<ASV> And the woman came to Saul (for he was very much troubled) and said to him: Behold thy handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand: and I hearkened unto the words which thou spokest to me.

<ASV> Be free from the love of money and pleased with the things which you have; for he himself has said, I will be with you at all times.
<ASV> (At that time also when they were in Silo, no one of them was found there.)
<ASV> I said to you, "I am Yahweh your God. You shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell." But you have not listened to my voice.'"
<ASV> Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
<ASV> So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.
<ASV> And the woman came as the morning appeared, and she fell at the entrance of the man's house where her master was, until daylight.
<ASV> Here I am: testify against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I injured? or of whose hand have I received any ransom and blinded mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it to you.

<ASV> And Samuel answered Saul and said, I am the seer: go up before me to the high place, and ye shall eat with me to-day; and to-morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.
<ASV> So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. Then the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon David from that day on. Then Samuel got up and went to Ramah.
<ASV> and Abimelech hath fought against the city all that day, and captureth the city, and the people who  in it he hath slain, and he breaketh down the city, and soweth it  salt.
<ASV> And the power of the children of Israel went on increasing against Jabin, king of Canaan, till he was cut off.
<ASV> For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house.
<ASV> yea, I ask thee also, true yokefellow, assist them, who have contended along with me in the glad tidings, with Clement also, and my other fellow-labourers, whose names  in  book of life.
<ASV> Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
<ASV> So Moab was broken that day under the hand of Israel. And for eighty years the land had peace.
<ASV> And Samson went down to Timnah, and he saw a woman in Timnah from the daughters of the Philistines.
<ASV> And Abigail came to Nabal: and behold he had a feast in his house, like the feast of a king, and Nabal's heart was merry: for he was very drunk: and she told him nothing less or more until morning.
<ASV> Then you are to go on from there, and when you come to the oak-tree of Tabor, you will see three men going up to God to Beth-el, one having with him three young goats and another three cakes of bread and another a skin full of wine:
<ASV> This  the covenant which I will establish towards them after those days, saith  Lord: Giving my laws into their hearts, I will write them also in their understandings;
<ASV> and Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, is standing before it in those days -- saying, `Do I add again to go out to battle with the sons of Benjamin, my brother, or do I cease?' And Jehovah saith, `Go up, for to-morrow I give him into thy hand.'
<ASV> And Saul commanded his servants to speak to David privately, saying: Behold thou pleasest the king, and all his servants love thee. Now therefore be the king's son in law.
<ASV> Who through faith overcame kingdoms, did righteousness, got their reward, kept the mouths of lions shut,
<ASV> But Yahweh's Spirit came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together to follow him.
<ASV> Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:
<ASV> They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
<ASV> Moreover see and know, O my father, the hem of thy robe in my hand, that when I cut, off the hem of thy robe, I would not put out my hand against thee. Reflect, and see, that there is no evil in my hand, nor iniquity, neither have I sinned against thee: but thou liest in wait for my life, to take it away.
<ASV> Then said Saul to the people that were with him, Muster now, and see who is gone from us. And they mustered, and behold, Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there.
<ASV> Put out the power of fire, got safely away from the edge of the sword, were made strong when they had been feeble, became full of power in war, and put to flight the armies of the nations.
<ASV> And Saul saith, `Cast between me and Jonathan my son;' and Jonathan is captured.
<ASV> From the day that the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, the time was long; for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh.
<ASV> The Philistine said to David, "Come to me so that I can give your flesh to the birds of heaven and to the wild animals of the field!"
<ASV> And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
<ASV> Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
<ASV> The one rock went up on the north in front of Michmash and the other on the south in front of Geba.
<ASV> And Achish answereth and saith unto David, `I have known that thou  good in mine eyes as a messenger of God; only, the princes of the Philistines have said, He doth not go up with us into battle;
<ASV> But not a man put his hand to his mouth for fear of the curse.
<ASV> And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come to me now when ye are in trouble?
<ASV> We shall come to a people that is secure, into a spacious country, and the Lord will deliver the place to us, in which there is no want of any thing that groweth on the earth.
<ASV> And the Philistine saith unto David, `Am I a dog that thou art coming unto me with staves?' and the Philistine revileth David by his gods,
<ASV> And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
<ASV> for it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to  good pleasure.
<ASV> And that night God did so; for the wool was dry, and there was dew on all the earth round it.
<ASV> Till now you have not given your blood in your fight against sin:
<ASV> and Israel sendeth messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me pass over, I pray thee, through thy land, and the king of Edom hearkened not; and also unto the king of Moab hath  sent, and he hath not been willing; and Israel abideth in Kadesh,
<ASV> And to leave the crime of the murder of the seventy sons of Jerobaal, and the shedding of their blood upon Abimelech their brother, and upon the rest of the princes of the Sichemites, who aided him.
<ASV> And it was told Saul that David was come to Ceila: and Saul said: The Lord hath delivered him into my hands, and he is shut up, being come into a city, that hath gates and bars.
<ASV> And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;
<ASV> And he put his hand into his scrip, and took a stone, and cast it with the sling, and fetching it about struck the Philistine in the forehead: and the stone was fixed in his forehead, and he fell on his face upon the earth.
<ASV> Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
<ASV> But if you are afraid, go down to the camp with Purah your servant,
<ASV> Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.
<ASV> and I have drawn unto thee, unto the brook Kishon, Sisera, head of the host of Jabin, and his chariot, and his multitude, and have given him into thy hand.'
<ASV> What will come on us, if we do not give our minds to such a great salvation? a salvation of which our fathers first had knowledge through the words of the Lord, and which was made certain to us by those to whom his words came;
<ASV> Because it is like the sin of witchcraft, to rebel: and like the crime of idolatry, to refuse to obey. Forasmuch therefore as thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord hath also rejected thee from being king.
<ASV> May God do so and so, and add more to the foes of David, if I leave of all that belong to him till the morning, any that pisseth against the wall.

<ASV> so I swore in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest.
<ASV> according to my eager expectation and hope, that I will be put to shame in nothing, but with all boldness, even now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether through life or through death.

<ASV> and Saul hath pity -- also the people -- on Agag, and on the best of the flock, and of the herd, and of the seconds, and on the lambs, and on all that  good, and have not been willing to devote them; and all the work, despised and wasted -- it they devoted.
<ASV> When these signs come to you, do for yourself what your hand finds to do, for God will be with you.

<ASV> How much more if the people had well eaten to-day of the spoil of its enemies which it hath found, for now, the smiting hath not been great among the Philistines.'

<ASV> And it cometh to pass, because she distressed him with her words all the days, and doth urge him, and his soul is grieved to death,

<ASV> And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.

<ASV> According to all the deeds that they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.
<ASV> And Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh, for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of Yahweh.

<ASV> Being circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; according to the law, a Pharisee:
<ASV> And the Philistines put their forces in order against Israel, and the fighting was hard, and Israel was overcome by the Philistines, who put to the sword about four thousand of their army in the field.
<ASV> But you this day have rejected your God, who only hath saved you out of all your evils and your tribulations: and you have said: Nay: but set a king over us. Now therefore stand before the Lord by your tribes, and by your families.

<ASV> Let us therefore go out to him outside of the camp, bearing his reproach.
<ASV> But he himself, turning back from the stone images at Gilgal, said, I have something to say to you in secret, O king. And he said, Let there be quiet. Then all those who were waiting before him went out.
<ASV> saying, "I will declare your name to my brothers. Among of the congregation I will sing your praise."

<ASV> and the sons of Israel have not remembered Jehovah their God, who is delivering them out of the hand of all their enemies round about,
<ASV> For a will is in force concerning those who are dead, since it is never in force when the one who made the will is alive.
<ASV> Brothers, be imitators together of me, and note those who walk this way, even as you have us for an example.
<ASV> Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.

Behold, the day is ending. Stay here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow go on your way early, that you may go home."
<ASV> And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.
<ASV> I know how to be humbled, and I know also how to abound. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.
<ASV> And began to shout out after them. They looked back, and said to Michas: What aileth thee? Why dost thou cry?

<ASV> by faith, Joseph dying, concerning the outgoing of the sons of Israel did make mention, and concerning his bones did give command.
<ASV> And David got up and came to the place where Saul's tents were: and David had a view of the place where Saul was sleeping with Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of his army: and Saul was sleeping inside the ring of carts, and the tents of the people were all round him.
<ASV> And Eli is a son of ninety and eight years, and his eyes have stood, and he hath not been able to see.
<ASV> And Hannah riseth after eating in Shiloh, and after drinking, and Eli the priest is sitting on the throne by the side-post of the temple of Jehovah.
<ASV> And David said: The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David: Go, and the Lord be with thee.
<ASV> So David hid himself in the field. When the new moon came, the king was seated at the feast.
<ASV> waiting from henceforth until his enemies be set [for the] footstool of his feet.
<ASV> Then the lords of the Philistines gathered together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands.
<ASV> And the young man arose to set forward with his wife and servant. And his father in law spoke to him again: Consider that the day is declining, and draweth toward evening: tarry with me to day also, and spend the day in mirth, and to morrow thou shalt depart, that thou mayest go into thy house.
<ASV> And Dalila said to him: Behold thou hast mocked me, and hast told me a false thing: but now at least tell me wherewith thou mayest be bound.
<ASV> And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.
<ASV> And Eli calleth Samuel, and saith, `Samuel, my son;' and he saith, `Here  I.'
<ASV> When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
<ASV> And the ark of God was taken; and Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, were put to the sword.
<ASV> David said to Abner, "Aren't you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord, the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.
<ASV> And David got up early in the morning, and, giving the sheep into the care of a keeper, took the things and went as Jesse had said; and he came to the lines where the carts were, when the army was going out to the fight giving their war-cry.
<ASV> of anything which cometh out from the wine-vine she doth not eat, and wine and strong drink she doth not drink, and any unclean thing she doth not eat; all that I have commanded her she doth observe.'
<ASV> Now it is my purpose to make clear to you, brothers, that the cause of the good news has been helped by my experiences;
<ASV> so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest, but He who spake unto him: `My Son thou art, I to-day have begotten thee;'
<ASV> Then they got up and went to Ziph before Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah, to the south of Jeshimon.
<ASV> in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, Thou didst not delight,
<ASV> And the children of Israel did not keep in their minds the Lord their God, who had been their saviour from all their haters on every side;
<ASV> And what Samuel had said happened to all Israel. And Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
<ASV> The Sichemites also were rewarded for what they had done, and the curse of Joatham the son of Jerobaal came upon them.
<ASV> And there came a man of God to Heli, and said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Did I not plainly appear to thy father's house, when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharao?

<ASV> And news was given to Saul that David had been seen, and the men who were with him: now Saul was in Gibeah, seated under the tree in the high place, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were in their places before him.
<ASV> The children of Benjamin did so, and took wives for themselves, according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off. They went and returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them.
<ASV> And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
<ASV> And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah when Ehud is dead,
<ASV> And Saul said to his servant: Thy word is very good, come, let us go. And they went into the city, where the man of God was.
<ASV> And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
<ASV> And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
<ASV> though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I yet more:
<ASV> Then David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army. Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him.
<ASV> They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him.
<ASV> And when Delilah saw that he had let her see into his heart, she sent word to the chiefs of the Philistines saying, Come up this time, for he has let out all his heart to me. Then the chiefs of the Philistines came to her, with the money in their hands.
<ASV> Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is not troublesome to me, but is a safeguard for you.

<ASV> So the land rested forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died.
<ASV> Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until there was not enough strength in them to weep.
<ASV> The children of Benjamin said, "They are struck down before us, as at the first." But the children of Israel said, "Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways."
<ASV> So Samuel turned again after Saul: and Saul adored the Lord.
<ASV> Thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in that he hath subjected all things to him, he left nothing not subject to him. But now we see not as yet all things subject to him.
<ASV> circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;

<ASV> And he sendeth, and bringeth him in, and he  ruddy, with beauty of eyes, and of good appearance; and Jehovah saith, `Rise, anoint him, for this  he.'
<ASV> And Israel was in great need because of Midian; and the cry of the children of Israel went up to the Lord.
<ASV> And they speak to him, saying, No, but we certainly bind thee, and have given thee into their hand, and we certainly do not put thee to death;' and they bind him with two thick bands, new ones, and bring him up from the rock.
<ASV> Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.
<ASV> and Samson saith, `Let me die with the Philistines,' and he inclineth himself powerfully, and the house falleth on the princes, and on all the people who  in it, and the dead whom he hath put to death in his death are more than those whom he put to death in his life.
<ASV> So that there is still a Sabbath-keeping for the people of God.
<ASV> And Jonathan answereth Saul his father, and saith unto him, `Why is he put to death? what hath he done?'
<ASV> And he sent and brought him in. And he was ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance and beautiful appearance. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.
<ASV> And the children of Ammon shouting together, pitched their tents in Galaad: against whom the children of Israel assembled themselves together and camped in Maspha.

<ASV> The latter do so from love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.
<ASV> And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.
<ASV> And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
<ASV> After all that generation were gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them, who didn't know Yahweh, nor the work which he had done for Israel.
<ASV> And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God which he commanded thee; for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom over Israel for ever.
<ASV> Then Abimelech and the divisions that were with him dashed out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, and the two divisions dashed out against all who were in the field, and they killed them.
<ASV> For he was looking for the strong town, whose builder and maker is God.
<ASV> And David said to Abiathar, I was certain that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would take the news to Saul: I am responsible for the lives of all your father's family.
<ASV> and they call the name of that place Bochim, and sacrifice there to Jehovah.
<ASV> And Jephthah took an oath to the Lord, and said, If you will give the children of Ammon into my hands,
<ASV> Then crying out to the Lord, they said, We have done evil, because we have been turned away from the Lord, worshipping the Baals and the Astartes: but now, make us safe from those who are against us and we will be your servants.
<ASV> They answered them and said, "There is. Look, he is just in front of you! Hurry now, because he has come to the town today, because there is a sacrifice for the people today at the high place.
<ASV> But only a great fear of being judged, and of the fire of wrath which will be the destruction of the haters of God.
<ASV> Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord thy God.
<ASV> And the lookouts of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin saw that the multitude surged back and forth.
<ASV> And it came about, that when he went away from Samuel, God gave him a changed heart: and all those signs took place that day.
<ASV> And Jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for Jehovah gave thee into  hand this day, and I would not stretch forth my hand against Jehovah's anointed.
<ASV> and Jehovah had uncovered the ear of Samuel one day before the coming of Saul, saying,
<ASV> Therefore, leaving behind the elementary message about Christ, let us move on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God,
<ASV> Please do not let my lord set his heart against this worthless man, Nabal; for as his name, so is he. Nabal is his name, and stupidity is with him! But I, your female servant, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.
<ASV> And he said, "Go." He sent her away for two months, and she went with her friends, and she lamented over her virginity on the mountains.
<ASV> But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.
<ASV> and if, indeed, they had been mindful of that from which they came forth, they might have had an opportunity to return,

<ASV> And the men of Ephraim came and said to him, Why did you not send for us when you went to war against Midian? And they said sharp and angry words to him.
<ASV> And Saul said to the Lord: O Lord God of Israel, give a sign, by which we may know, what the meaning is, that thou answerest not thy servant to day. If this iniquity be in me, or in my son Jonathan, give a proof: or if this iniquity be in thy people, give holiness. And Jonathan and Saul were taken, and the people escaped.
<ASV> as to circumcision, [I received it] the eighth day; of  race of Israel, of  tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of Hebrews; as to  law, a Pharisee;

<ASV> Wherefore I was wroth with this generation, and said, They always err in heart; and *they* have not known my ways;
<ASV> So then Yahweh, the God of Israel, has driven out the Amorites from before his people Israel, and you want to possess it?

<ASV> David strapped his sword on his clothing, and he tried to move; for he had not tested it. David said to Saul, "I can't go with these; for I have not tested them." Then David took them off.

<ASV> then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Please let me pass through your land;' but the king of Edom didn't listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel stayed in Kadesh.
<ASV> So they set up for themselves the carved divine image that Micah had made, all the days that the house of God was in Shiloh.

<ASV> and saith, `This is the custom of the king who doth reign over you: Your sons he doth take, and hath appointed for himself among his chariots, and among his horsemen, and they have run before his chariots;

<ASV> The children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
<ASV> Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, "Please let us cross through your land," but the king of Edom would not listen. And they also sent messengers to the king of Moab, but he was not willing. So Israel stayed in Kadesh.

<ASV> And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.

<ASV> who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly things, as Moses hath been divinely warned, being about to construct the tabernacle, for `See (saith He) thou mayest make all things according to the pattern that was shewn to thee in the mount;') --
<ASV> And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered together their armies to be prepared for war against Israel: and Achis said to David: Know thou now assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to the war, thou, and thy men.
<ASV> And Achish saith, `Whither have ye pushed to-day?' and David saith, `Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelite, and unto the south of the Kenite.'
<ASV> And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
<ASV> Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
<ASV> Wherever they went out, Yahweh's hand was against them for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them; and they were very distressed.
<ASV> For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not profit *them*, not being mixed with faith in those who heard.

<ASV> David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.
<ASV> For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.

<ASV> For for me to live  Christ, and to die gain;
<ASV> And yet you have forsaken me, and have worshipped strange gods: therefore I will deliver you no more:
<ASV> Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak; for your servant hears."
<ASV> For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it, and produces a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God;
<ASV> And when every one had seen this, they all cried out: There was never such a thing done in Israel from the day that our fathers came up out of Egypt, until this day: give sentence, and decree in common what ought to be done.
<ASV> And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
<ASV> The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went with the people.
<ASV> And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
<ASV> David said to Achish, "Therefore you will know what your servant can do." Achish said to David, "Therefore I will make you my bodyguard forever."
<ASV> And David riseth early in the morning, and leaveth the flock to a keeper, and lifteth up, and goeth, as Jesse commanded him, and he cometh in to the path, and to the force which is going out unto the rank, and they have shouted for battle;
<ASV> And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If ye return to Jehovah with all your heart, put away the strange gods and the Ashtoreths from among you, and apply your hearts unto Jehovah, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
<ASV> And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee king over Israel?
<ASV> Then let us all, who have come to full growth, be of this mind: and if in anything you are of a different mind, even this will God make clear to you:
<ASV> David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took and went, as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the place of the wagons, as the army which was going out to the fight shouted for the battle.
<ASV> For it was fitting for him for whom are all things and through whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory to perfect the originator of their salvation through sufferings.
<ASV> So the woman gave birth to a son, and gave him the name Samson; and he became a man and the blessing of the Lord was on him.

<ASV> And the Gileadites took the crossing-places of Jordan against the Ephraimites; and when any of the men of Ephraim who had gone in flight said, let me go over; the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? And if he said, No;
<ASV> and in this  again, `If they shall enter into My rest -- ;'
<ASV> They came to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brothers asked them, "What do you say?"
<ASV> For he was expecting the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
<ASV> And Gaal the son of Obed cried: Who is Abimelech, and what is Sichem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerobaal, and hath made Zebul his servant ruler over the men of Emor the father of Sichem? Why then shall we serve him?
<ASV> and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.'
<ASV> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the fierceness of the king: for he endured as seeing him that is invisible.
<ASV> But if ye do wickedly, ye shall perish, both ye and your king.
<ASV> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
<ASV> Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
<ASV> But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,
<ASV> And David goeth on, he and six hundred men who  with him, and they come in unto the brook of Besor, and those left have stood still,

<ASV> Saul sent messengers to seize David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, God's Spirit came on Saul's messengers, and they also prophesied.
<ASV> And Saul and his men went in search of him. And David had word of it, so he came down to the rock in the waste land of Maon. And Saul, hearing of this, went after David into the waste land of Maon.
<ASV> They were left for testing Israel, to know whether they would keep the commands of Yahweh that he commanded their ancestors through the hand of Moses.
<ASV> Therefore on that day he named him Jerub-Baal, saying, "Let Baal contend against him, because he has broken down his altar."
<ASV> He raiseth from the dust the poor, From a dunghill He lifteth up the needy, To cause  to sit with nobles, Yea, a throne of honour He doth cause them to inherit, For to Jehovah  the fixtures of earth, And He setteth on them the habitable world.
<ASV> And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
<ASV> And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
<ASV> Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
<ASV> One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to his armor bearer, "Come and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines which is over there." But he did not tell his father.
<ASV> and she saith, `I do certainly go with thee; only, surely thy glory is not on the way which thou art going, for into the hand of a woman doth Jehovah sell Sisera;' and Deborah riseth and goeth with Barak to Kedesh.
<ASV> Was it to-day that I began to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king charge anything to his servant,  to all the house of my father; for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
<ASV> The God's Spirit came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger burned hot.
<ASV> Because of this it was necessary for him to be made like his brothers in every way, so that he might be a high priest full of mercy and keeping faith in everything to do with God, making offerings for the sins of the people.
<ASV> And they went up and encamped in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah; therefore they call that place Mahaneh-Dan to this day: behold, it is behind Kirjath-jearim.

<ASV> The Philistine came near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.

<ASV> They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove the three sons of Anak out of there.

<ASV> One day the trees went out to make a king for themselves; and they said to the olive-tree, Be king over us.
<ASV> and Gideon maketh it into an ephod, and setteth it up in his city, in Ophrah, and all Israel go a-whoring after it there, and it is to Gideon and to his house for a snare.
<ASV> while God was testifying at the same time by signs and wonders and various miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will.
<ASV> Then Gideon, hearing the story of the dream and the sense in which they took it, gave worship; then he went back to the tents of Israel, and said, Up! for the Lord has given the army of Midian into your hands.
<ASV> But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don't know what I will choose.

<ASV> And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
<ASV> Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.

<ASV> But the vine said to them, 'Should I stop producing my wine that makes the gods and men happy, to go sway over the trees?'
<ASV> That all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one to inform me, especially when even my son hath entered into league with the soil of Isai?

<ASV> And his lord saith unto him, `Let us not turn aside unto the city of a stranger, that is not of the sons of Israel, thither, but we have passed over unto Gibeah.'

<ASV> having chosen rather to be afflicted with the people of God, than to have sin's pleasure for a season,
<ASV> Him then I am hoping to send as quickly as possible, when I am able to see how things will go for me:
<ASV> Forsaking him, and serving Baal and Astaroth.
<ASV> And in all his undertakings David did wisely; and the Lord was with him.
<ASV> and he said to him, "Thus says Jephthah, 'Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites,
<ASV> This day Yahweh will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head! Then I will give the corpses of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of heaven and to the animals of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God who is for Israel.
<ASV> Now the sons of Heli were children of Belial, not knowing the Lord,
<ASV> I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the Lord, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.
<ASV> just as it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all of you are sharers of grace with me.

<ASV> And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.

<ASV> and choose him out of all the tribes of Israel, to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear the ephod before me? and I gave unto the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel.
<ASV> Asher did not dispossess the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor Ahlab, nor Achzib, nor Helbah, nor Aphik, nor Rehob;

<ASV> and he took it out in his hands, and went on, and ate as he went. And he came to his father and to his mother, and gave them, and they ate; but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.
<ASV> And they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have acted perversely: roll me now a great stone.
<ASV> And all this assembly shall know, that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for it is his battle, and he will deliver you into our hands.

<ASV> For God is my witness, that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
<ASV> So God repaid the wickedness that Abimelech committed against his father by killing his seventy brothers.

<ASV> As soon as you enter the town, you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice. Then afterward the invited guests will eat. So then, go up, because you will find him today!"
<ASV> So turning back from going after David, Saul went against the Philistines: so that place was named Sela-hammah-lekoth.
<ASV> But Adoni-Bezek fled. They pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.
<ASV> Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. The Italians greet you.

<ASV> Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
<ASV> And it was told to Saul, "David is in Naioth in Ramah."
<ASV> Two of David's wives had been taken captive. Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
<ASV> So all the people went to Gilgal; and there in Gilgal they made Saul king before the Lord; and peace-offerings were offered before the Lord; and there Saul and all the men of Israel were glad with great joy.
<ASV> Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, "You are blessed by Yahweh! I have performed the commandment of Yahweh."
<ASV> David went out whenever Saul sent him, and he succeeded. So Saul appointed him over the men of the war, and it pleased all the people and even pleased the servants of Saul.
<ASV> Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger burned against David, and he said, "Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle."
<ASV> And all the men of Israel have risen from their place, and arrange themselves at Baal-Tamar, and the ambush of Israel is coming forth out of its place, out of the meadow of Gibeah.
<ASV> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.
<ASV> But now they aspire to a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.
<ASV> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord, and there abide for ever.
<ASV> lo, I am placing the fleece of wool in the threshing-floor: if dew is on the fleece alone, and on all the earth drought -- then I have known that Thou dost save Israel by my hand, as Thou hast spoken;'
<ASV> So now, if you have done truly and uprightly in making Abimelech king, and if you have done well to Jerubbaal and his house in reward for the work of his hands;
<ASV> And the king saith to her, `Do not fear; for what hast thou seen?' and the woman saith unto Saul, `Gods I have seen coming up out of the earth.'
<ASV> Why have you kicked away my victims, and my gifts which I commanded to be offered in the temple: and thou hast rather honoured thy sons than me, to eat the firstfruits of every sacrifice of my people Israel?
<ASV> For it is evident that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses said nothing concerning priests.
<ASV> And the woman beareth a son, and calleth his name Samson, and the youth groweth, and Jehovah doth bless him,
<ASV> For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
<ASV> But Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for to-day Jehovah has wrought deliverance in Israel.
<ASV> So that, taking courage, we may say, The Lord  my helper, and I will not be afraid: what will man do unto me?
<ASV> And the man said to Eli, I have come from the army and have come in flight today from the fight. And he said, How did it go, my son?
<ASV> `Therefore -- the affirmation of Jehovah, God of Israel -- I certainly said, Thy house and the house of thy father, do walk up and down before Me to the age; and now -- the affirmation of Jehovah -- Far be it from Me! for he who is honouring Me, I honour, and those despising Me, are lightly esteemed.
<ASV> Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear --
<ASV> So that it became clear through all the Praetorium, and to all the rest, that I was a prisoner on account of Christ;
<ASV> Anyone who rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
<ASV> And Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
<ASV> He rose up and followed his wife: and coming to the man, said to him: Art thou he that spoke to the woman? And he answered: I am.
<ASV> Then come down, thou, the remnant of nobles, [as his] people; Jehovah! come down with me in the midst of the mighty ones.
<ASV> And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, thou art barren and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive and bear a son.
<ASV> And David said to himself, Some day death will come to me by the hand of Saul: the only thing for me to do is to get away into the land of the Philistines; then Saul will give up hope of taking me in any part of the land of Israel: and so I may be able to get away from him.
<ASV> And his brethren came down, and all the house of his father, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zoreah and Eshtaol in the sepulchre of Manoah his father. And he had judged Israel twenty years.
<ASV> being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,
<ASV> Then it was said to Saul, See, the people are sinning against the Lord, taking the blood with the flesh. And he said to those who gave him the news, Now let a great stone be rolled to me here.
<ASV> And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
<ASV> Both the lion and the bear hath thy servant smitten, and this uncircumcised Philistine hath been as one of them, for he hath reproached the ranks of the living God.'
<ASV> And the Lord said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
<ASV> And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
<ASV> let's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water,
<ASV> and this  to thee the sign that cometh unto thy two sons, unto Hophni and Phinehas -- in one day they die both of them;
<ASV> And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the Lord. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the Lord.
<ASV> And they called the name of the city Dan, after Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel; but the former name of the city was Laish.
<ASV> And the people were moved with pity for Benjamin, because the Lord had let his wrath loose on the tribes of Israel.
<ASV> if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
<ASV> Then you will go on from there and further you will come to the oak of Tabor. There three men will meet you, who are going up to God at Bethel. One will be carrying three male kid goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and one will be carrying a skin of wine.
<ASV> And Samson said to them: I will propose to you a riddle, which if you declare unto me within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty shirts, and as many coats:
<ASV> David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
<ASV> So they sent and gathered all the rulers of the Philistines, and they said, "Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it return to its place, so that it will not kill us and our people." For a deadly confusion was throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
<ASV> Now the words which David had spoken were heard and they reported them to Saul, and he summoned him.
<ASV> So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.
<ASV> So do all Thine enemies perish, O Jehovah, And those loving Him  As the going out of the sun in its might!' and the land resteth forty years.
<ASV> Yahweh's Spirit came mightily on him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men of them, and took their plunder, then gave the changes of clothing to those who declared the riddle. His anger burned, and he went up to his father's house.
<ASV> But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.
<ASV> About the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, "Don't be afraid; for you have given birth to a son." But she didn't answer, neither did she regard it.
<ASV> Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and about three thousand men and women were on the roof, looking on while Samson made sport.
<ASV> And the messengers come in, and lo, the teraphim  on the bed, and the mattress of goats' ,  his pillows.
<ASV> For to which of the messengers said He ever, `My Son thou art -- I to-day have begotten thee?' and again, `I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?'
<ASV> saying, `I will declare Thy name to my brethren, in the midst of an assembly I will sing praise to Thee;' and again, `I will be trusting on Him;'
<ASV> Then the Levites took down the ark of Yahweh and the container that was beside it, in which were the gold objects, and they set them on the large stone. Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings, and they made sacrifices to Yahweh on that day.
<ASV> After him Jair the Gileadite rose up, and he judged Israel twenty-two years.
<ASV> In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;
<ASV> and the servants of Achish say unto him, `Is not this David king of the land? is it not of this one they sing in dances, saying, `Saul smote among his thousands, and David among his myriads?'
<ASV> and Saul is eyeing David from that day and thenceforth.
<ASV> Then the two of them made a covenant before Yahweh. David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went to his house.
<ASV> And Saul would have sent his spear through him, pinning him to the wall, but he got away and the spear went into the wall: and that night David went in flight and got away.
<ASV> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
<ASV> Now when he had gone, the king's servants came, and saw that the doors of the summer-house were locked; and they said, It may be that he is in his summer-house for a private purpose.
<ASV> Yahweh's angel appeared to him, and said to him, "Yahweh is with you, you mighty man of valor!"
<ASV> The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.
<ASV> Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct ye yourselves, that, whether having come and seen you, whether being absent I may hear of the things concerning you, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul, striving together for the faith of the good news,
<ASV> And the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah, and Jehovah raiseth to them a saviour, Ehud son of Gera, a Benjamite (a man -- shut of his right hand), and the sons of Israel send by his hand a present to Eglon king of Moab;
<ASV> But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.
<ASV> Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out of death, with strong crying and tears; (and having been heard because of his piety;)
<ASV> and he saith, Send me away, I pray thee, for a family sacrifice we have in the city, and my brother himself hath given command to me, and now, if I have found grace in thine eyes, let me go away, I pray thee, and see my brethren; therefore he hath not come unto the table of the king.'
<ASV> The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;
<ASV> And the Spirit of Jehovah will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
<ASV> And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?
<ASV> Gilead has remained beyond the Jordan. Why did Dan dwell as a foreigner with ships? Asher sat at the coast of the waters, and by his coves he has been settling down.
<ASV> Jehovah -- broken down are His adversaries, Against them in the heavens He thundereth: Jehovah judgeth the ends of earth, And giveth strength to His king, And exalteth the horn of His anointed.'
<ASV> but David went back and forth from Saul to feed the sheep of his father in Bethlehem.
<ASV> "In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the caravans had ceased, the travelers, they kept to the byways.
<ASV> And the Lord looked upon him, and said: Go in this thy strength, and thou shalt deliver Israel out of the hand of Madian: know that I have sent thee.
<ASV> and Elon the Zebulunite dieth, and is buried in Aijalon, in the land of Zebulun.
<ASV> Won't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.
<ASV> Even as also in another  he says, *Thou*  a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.
<ASV> Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.
<ASV> So Saul was watching David with suspicion from that day onward.
<ASV> And it came to pass the next day that an evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house, but David played with his hand, as on other days; and the spear was in Saul's hand.
<ASV> And after him, Elon the Zebulonite was judge of Israel; and he was judge of Israel for ten years.
<ASV> Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, "Where did you go?" He said, "To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel."
<ASV> And Abigail cometh in unto Nabal, and lo, he hath a banquet in his house, like a banquet of the king, and the heart of Nabal  glad within him, and he  drunk unto excess, and she hath not declared to him anything, less or more, till the light of the morning.
<ASV> Then Samuel said, Let all Israel come to Mizpah and I will make prayer to the Lord for you.
<ASV> And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
<ASV> He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
<ASV> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, "Yahweh has not chosen this one, either."
<ASV> And Jonathan, answering his father Saul, said to him, Why is he to be put to death? What has he done?
<ASV> And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
<ASV> Then David said to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin: but I come to you in the name of the Lord of armies, the God of the armies of Israel on which you have put shame.
<ASV> For they who say such things shew clearly that they seek  country.
<ASV> always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy,
<ASV> and a certain woman doth cast a piece of a rider on the head of Abimelech, and breaketh his skull,
<ASV> Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, nor didst the fierceness of His anger on Amalek -- therefore this thing hath Jehovah done to thee this day;
<ASV> Now the angel of the Lord came and took his seat under the oak-tree in Ophrah, in the field of Joash the Abiezrite; and his son Gideon was crushing grain in the place where the grapes were crushed, so that the Midianites might not see it.
<ASV> Then David and his men, about six hundred of them, went out of Keilah, and got away wherever they were able to go. And Saul, hearing that David had got away from Keilah, did not go there.
<ASV> And when the Philistines had beard this, and it was noised about among them, that Samson was come into the city, they surrounded him, setting guards at the gate of the city, and watching there all the night in silence, that in the morning they might kill him as he went out.
<ASV> and thou hast beheld an adversary [in My] habitation, in all that He doth good with Israel, and there is not an old man in thy house all the days.
<ASV> And they put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreth, and they fastened his corpse to the wall of Beth Shan.
<ASV> Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice.
<ASV> But Hannah did not go, for she said to her husband, I will not go till the child has been taken from the breast, and then I will take him with me and put him before the Lord, where he may be for ever.
<ASV> So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
<ASV> Then Samson went down to Thamnatlia, and seeing there a woman of the daughters of the Philistines,
<ASV> and he hath thirty sons riding on thirty ass-colts, and they have thirty cities, (they call them Havoth-Jair unto this day), which  in the land of Gilead;
<ASV> Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth and groweth old, is near its end.
<ASV> And Samuel said: Doth the Lord desire holocausts and victims, and not rather that the voice of the Lord should be obeyed? For obedience is better than sacrifices: and to hearken rather than to offer the fat of rams.
<ASV> And, "You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the works of your hands.
<ASV> As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and said the same words; and David heard them.
<ASV> When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread around over all the ground, eating, drinking, and dancing, because of all the great plunder that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
<ASV> Like all the deeds they have done from the day I brought them up from Egypt until this day, they have forsaken me and have served other gods—so they are doing to you also.
<ASV> but one has testified somewhere, saying, What is man, that thou rememberest him, or son of man that thou visitest him?
<ASV> And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
<ASV> He said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me.
<ASV> nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,
<ASV> But if you continue to do wickedness, both you and your king will be swept away."
<ASV> And the lords of the Philistines went on with their hundreds and their thousands, and David and his men came after with Achish.
<ASV> Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.
<ASV> And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord.
<ASV> for whom  Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives.
<ASV> and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; the priest took of it all that the flesh-hook brought up. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there.
<ASV> And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
<ASV> And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
<ASV> And this we will do, if God permits.
<ASV> And Ephraim hath not dispossessed the Canaanite who is dwelling in Gezer, and the Canaanite dwelleth in its midst, in Gezer.
<ASV> in order that you may become blameless and innocent, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as stars in the world,
<ASV> But I am very glad in the Lord that your care for me has come to life again; though you did in fact take thought for me, but you were not able to give effect to it.
<ASV> and being perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him,
<ASV> Speak to the people, and proclaim in the hearing of all, I Whosoever is fearful and timorous, let him return. So two and twenty thousand men went away from mount Galaad and returned home, and only ten thousand remained.
<ASV> Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.
<ASV> For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on.
<ASV> And he saith unto all Israel, `Ye -- ye are on one side, and I and Jonathan my son are on another side;' and the people say unto Saul, `That which is good in thine eyes do.'
<ASV> Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he encamped against Thebez and captured it.
<ASV> Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.
<ASV> And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.
<ASV> And now the king goeth before you: but I am old and greyheaded: and my sons are with you: having then conversed with you from my youth unto this day, behold here I am.
<ASV> And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
<ASV> And these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle, indeed, at all times the priests do go in, performing the services,
<ASV> And Dalila said to him again: How long dost thou deceive me, and tell me lies? shew me wherewith thou mayest be bound. And Samson answered her: If thou plattest the seven locks of my head with a lace, and tying them round about a nail fastenest it in the ground, I shall be weak.
<ASV> And he smote them from Aroer till you come to Mennith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel, which is set with vineyards, with a very great slaughter: and the children of Ammon were humbled by the children of Israel.
<ASV> For that leaders led in Israel, For that the people willingly offered themselves, Bless Jehovah!
<ASV> So Abimelech went up Mount Zalmon, he and all his army that were with him, and Abimelech took the ax in his hand and cut down a bundle of brushwood, and he lifted it and put it on his shoulder. And he said to the army that was with him, "What you have seen me do, quickly do also."
<ASV> And when the burning began to rise up out of the city as a pillar of smoke, Benjamin looked behind, and behold, the whole city ascended [in smoke] to the heavens.
<ASV> for also our God  a consuming fire.
<ASV> For Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name's sake, because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people for himself.
<ASV> Only lead your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent I hear your circumstances, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul contending side by side for the faith of the gospel,
<ASV> `This  the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and upon their minds I will write them,'
<ASV> But if ye are without chastening, of which all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
<ASV> So then, prepare one new utility cart and two milking cows that have never had a yoke on them, and you must harness the cows to the utility cart and then turn their calves from following them to their stall.
<ASV> And if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the camp;
<ASV> And Jesse calleth unto Abinadab, and causeth him to pass by before Samuel; and he saith, `Also on this Jehovah hath not fixed.'
<ASV> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord.
<ASV> The kings came on to the fight, the kings of Canaan were warring; in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: they took no profit in money.
<ASV> They were making their hearts merry, when behold, the men of the city, sons of Belial, surrounded the house, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.
<ASV> And the watchers saw a man coming out of the town, and said to him, If you will make clear to us the way into the town, we will be kind to you.
<ASV> By faith Moses, when he became a man, had no desire to be named the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
<ASV> Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people who were with him were about six hundred men;
<ASV> Now Kish was the father of Saul, but Ner, the father of Abner, was the son of Abiel.
<ASV> And David said to Achimelech the priest: The king hath commanded me a business, and said: Let no man know the thing for which thou art sent by me, and what manner of commands I have given thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.
<ASV> Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served Yahweh before Eli the priest.
<ASV> And Jephthah cometh into Mizpeh, unto his house, and lo, his daughter is coming out to meet him with timbrels, and with choruses, and save her alone, he hath none, son or daughter.
<ASV> And behold, Saul came after the oxen from the field; and Saul said, What  the people that they weep? And they related to him the words of the men of Jabesh.
<ASV> So that my bands are made manifest in Christ, in all the court, and in all other places;
<ASV> May God severely punish the enemies of David and again do thus if I leave behind anything that is his until the morning, not even one male!"
<ASV> And Manoah saith unto his wife, `We certainly die, for we have seen God.'
<ASV> And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
<ASV> Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
<ASV> Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
<ASV> Because God had kept some better thing for us, so that it was not possible for them to become complete without us.
<ASV> He came to the men of Succoth, and he said, "Here is Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, 'Is the palm of Zebah and Zalmunna in your hand now, that we should give food to your weary men?'"
<ASV> "Then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down. Yahweh came down for me against the mighty.
<ASV> And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.
<ASV> And Saul casteth the javelin at him to smite him, and Jonathan knoweth that it hath been determined by his father to put David to death.
<ASV> Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the death; Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
<ASV> Now Hobab the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, had come up out of the town of palm-trees, with the children of Judah, into the waste land of Arad; and he went and was living among the Amalekites;
<ASV> But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:
<ASV> And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
<ASV> But his master said to him, We will not go out of our way into a strange town, whose people are not of the children of Israel; but we will go on to Gibeah.
<ASV> And he returned after a time to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion; and behold, [there was] a swarm of bees in the carcase of the lion, and honey;
<ASV> nor in order that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with blood not his own;
<ASV> Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.
<ASV> And they forgot the Lord their God, and he delivered them into the hands of Sisara, captain of the army of Hasor, and into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
<ASV> And it came to pass when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, that all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth shook.
<ASV> And Delilah said to Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what thou mightest be bound. And he said to her, If thou shouldest weave the seven locks of my head with the web.
<ASV> For a tent was prepared, the first one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the presentation of the loaves, which is called the holy place.
<ASV> For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
<ASV> And Zebul said to him, "Where then is your boast, you who said, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Is this not the army that you rejected? Please, go out now and fight against them."
<ASV> For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,
<ASV> Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, "Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire, but you prepared a body for me.
<ASV> All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.
<ASV> And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.

<ASV> And as for the matter about which you and I spoke, look, Yahweh is between you and me forever."
<ASV> have I lack of madmen, that ye have brought this one to rave in my presence? shall this  come into my house?
<ASV> for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,
<ASV> But if you are unable to explain it to me, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments." So they said to him, "Tell your riddle; let us hear it."
<ASV> Yahweh's angel came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.
<ASV> "It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments." Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night.
<ASV> After this he fell in love with a woman in the wadi of Sorek, and her name was Delilah.
<ASV> And to whom did he swear they would not enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient?
<ASV> God chose new leaders, then war was at the gates; a small shield or a spear was not seen among forty thousand in Israel.
<ASV> Only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;
<ASV> So he brought down the people to the water; and Yahweh said to Gideon, "Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set him by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink."
<ASV> And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.
<ASV> whither a forerunner for us did enter -- Jesus, after the order of Melchisedek chief priest having become -- to the age.
<ASV> Everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became captain over them. There were with him about four hundred men.
<ASV> Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,
<ASV> Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)
<ASV> Now Haber the Cinite had some time before departed from the rest of the Cinites his brethren the sons of Hobab, the kinsman of Moses: and had pitched his tents unto the valley which is called Sellnim, and was near Cedes.
<ASV> Then you will be crying out because of your king whom you have taken for yourselves; but the Lord will not give you an answer in that day.
<ASV> Then Saul said, Come here and give me the burned offering and the peace-offerings. And he made a burned offering to the Lord.
<ASV> And the two wives of David have been taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
<ASV> Therefore, we also having so great a cloud of witnesses set around us, every weight having put off, and the closely besetting sin, through endurance may we run the contest that is set before us,
<ASV> for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that  after the law  the Son -- to the age having been perfected.
<ASV> And he said to him, We are on our way from Beth-lehem-judah to the inmost parts of the hill-country of Ephraim: I came from there and went to Beth-lehem-judah: now I am on my way back to my house, but no man will take me into his house.
<ASV> and in this again, If they shall enter into my rest.
<ASV> And far from me be this sin against the Lord, that I should cease to pray for you, and I will teach you the good and right way.
<ASV> And again, when he is sending his only Son into the world, he says, Let all the angels of God give him worship.
<ASV> And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
<ASV> But solid food is for men of full growth, even for those whose senses are trained by use to see what is good and what is evil.
<ASV> So the children of Israel went forward against the children of Benjamin the second day.
<ASV> For men indeed swear by a greater, and with them the oath is a term to all dispute, as making matters sure.
<ASV> David's men said to him, "Behold, the day of which Yahweh said to you, 'Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.'" Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.
<ASV> all of the valiant men set out and went all night and took the corpse of Saul and the corpses of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan, and they came to Jabesh and burned them there.
<ASV> And the priest gave him holy ; for there was no bread there but the shew-loaves that were taken from before Jehovah, to put on hot bread in the day when they were taken away.
<ASV> Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David hurried to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them.
<ASV> While Saul was still speaking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more, so Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand!"
<ASV> (The descendants of Benjamin heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) And the Israelites said, "Tell us, how did this evil act occur?"
<ASV> I appeal to Euodia and I appeal to Syntyche to be in agreement in the Lord.
<ASV> For our commonwealth exists in heaven, from which also we eagerly await a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
<ASV> But into the second, the high priest alone, once a year: not without blood, which he offereth for his own, and the people's ignorance:
<ASV> And she saith unto him, `How dost thou say, I have loved thee, and thy heart is not with me? these three times thou hast played upon me, and hast not declared to me wherein thy great power .'
<ASV> For our citizenship is in the heavens, whence also a Saviour we await -- the Lord Jesus Christ --
<ASV> The boy therefore came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot: and Jonathan cried after the boy, and said: Behold the arrow is there further beyond thee.
<ASV> And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.
<ASV> Then Saul said to him, "Why did you conspire against me, you and the son of Jesse, when you gave to him bread and a sword, and by inquiring of God for him so that he might arise against me to ambush me as has been done this day?"
<ASV> And Moab was humbled that day under the hand of Israel: and the land rested eighty years.
<ASV> And David passeth over to the other side, and standeth on the top of the hill afar off -- great  the place between them;
<ASV> And Jonathan goeth up on his hands, and on his feet, and the bearer of his weapons after him; and they fall before Jonathan, and the bearer of his weapons is putting to death after him.
<ASV> Then Jonathan called out after the boy, "Quick, hurry, do not linger!" And Jonathan's servant collected the arrows and came to his master.
<ASV> For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.
<ASV> And he said to David, You are right and I am wrong: for you have given me back good, but I have given you evil.
<ASV> And the men of Ephraim say unto him, `What  this thing thou hast done to us -- not to call for us when thou didst go to fight with Midian?' and they strive with him severely;
<ASV> And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?
<ASV> For you are not come to a mountain that might be touched, and a burning fire, and a whirlwind, and darkness, and storm,
<ASV> And Jonathan said to David: Come and let us go out into the field. And when they were both of them gone out into the field,
<ASV> And the words were heard which David spoke, and they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.
<ASV> Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon: and it will be seen that you are not present, for there will be no one in your seat.
<ASV> And he said to her, Take your place at the door of the tent, and if anyone comes and says to you, Is there any man here, say, No.
<ASV> And to the church of the firstborn, who are written in the heavens, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the just made perfect,
<ASV> So he gave the silver back to his mother. Then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a metal-worker who made a pictured image and a metal image from them: and it was in the house of Micah.
<ASV> And Deborah said to Barak, "Get up! This is the day that Yahweh has given Sisera into your hand. Has Yahweh not gone out before you?" So Barak went out from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.
<ASV> `Afterwards thou dost come unto the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines , and it cometh to pass, at thy coming in thither to the city, that thou hast met a band of prophets coming down from the high place, and before them psaltery, and tabret, and pipe, and harp, and they are prophesying;
<ASV> And the children of Israel set ambushes round about the city of Gabaa:
<ASV> may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water;
<ASV> Because thou shalt conceive and bear a son, and no razor shall touch his head: for he shall be a Nazarite of God, from his infancy, and from his mother's womb, and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines.
<ASV> But if you are not able to give me the answer, then you will have to give me thirty linen robes and thirty changes of clothing. And they said to him, Put your hard question and let us see what it is.
<ASV> And crying out to the people and to Abner, the son of Ner, David said, Have you no answer to give, Abner? Then Abner said, Who is that crying out to the king?
<ASV> And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
<ASV> Then Gideon went in and made ready a young goat, and with an ephah of meal he made unleavened cakes: he put the meat in a basket and the soup in which it had been cooked he put in a pot, and he took it out to him under the oak-tree and gave it to him there.
<ASV> But the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah that he had sent him.
<ASV> And David saith unto him, `Dost thou bring me down unto this troop?' and he saith, `Swear to me by God -- thou dost not put me to death, nor dost thou shut me up into the hand of my lord -- and I bring thee down unto this troop.'
<ASV> And he said to his servant, Come, let us go on to one of these places, stopping for the night in Gibeah or Ramah.
<ASV> And Jehovah addeth to call again Samuel, and Samuel riseth and goeth unto Eli, and saith, `Here  I, for thou hast called for me;' and he saith, `I have not called, my son, turn back, lie down.'
<ASV> And I entreat you, brethren, suffer the word of the exhortation, for also through few words I have written to you.
<ASV> And there was the appointed sign to the men of Israel with the ambush -- their causing to go up a great volume of smoke from the city.
<ASV> The priest said, "Behold, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you would like to take that, take it; for there is no other except that here." David said, "There is none like that. Give it to me."
<ASV> Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
<ASV> Because thou didst not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce anger upon Amalek, therefore has Jehovah done this thing to thee this day.
<ASV> Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered, and said to their brothers, "Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you have to do."
<ASV> And he said to them: I desire one request of you: Give me the earlets of your spoils. For the Ismaelites were accustomed to wear golden earlets.
<ASV> For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
<ASV> And when David's servants came to Carmel, to Abigail, they said to her, David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.
<ASV> And the woman seeth Samuel, and crieth with a loud voice, and the woman speaketh unto Saul, saying, `Why hast thou deceived me -- and thou Saul?'
<ASV> And Othoniel the son of Cenez, the younger brother of Caleb, having taken it, he gave him Axa his daughter to wife.
<ASV> Now at the time that Saul saw David going out against the Philistines, he said to Abner the captain of the army: Of what family is this young man descended, Abner? And Abner said: As thy soul liveth, O king, I know not.
<ASV> Therefore he was obligated to be made like his brothers in all respects, in order that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things relating to God, in order to make atonement for the sins of the people.
<ASV> And David said to Saul: Who am I, or what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law of the king?
<ASV> And it came to pass when the judge died, that they turned back and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them: they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.
<ASV> Now Jehovah had apprised Samuel one day before Saul came, saying,
<ASV> And Jephthah said to them, "I and my people were engaged in great conflict with the Ammonites; I called you, but you did not deliver me from their hand.
<ASV> and they possess all the border of the Amorite from Arnon, and unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness, and unto the Jordan.
<ASV> And later, David was full of regret for cutting off Saul's skirt.
<ASV> and if ye are apart from chastening, of which all have become partakers, then bastards are ye, and not sons.
<ASV> And the people said to Samuel: Who is he that said: Shall Saul reign over us? Bring the men and we will kill them.
<ASV> Her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of donkeys. She brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
<ASV> Then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight.
<ASV> And he saith unto them, `A witness  Jehovah against you: and a witness  His anointed this day, that ye have not found anything in my hand;' and they say, `A witness.'
<ASV> I would go out after it and strike it down and rescue the sheep from its mouth. If it rose against me, I would grab it by its beard and strike it down and kill it.
<ASV> And had made the women and all who were there, small and great, prisoners: they had not put any of them to death, but had taken them all away.
<ASV> And Saul came to the city of the Amalekites, and set an ambush in the valley.
<ASV> Do not take your servant to be a good-for-nothing woman: for my words have come from my stored-up sorrow and pain.
<ASV> And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, a heap, two heaps, With the jawbone of an ass have I slain a thousand men.
<ASV> So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
<ASV> And Samuel saw Saul no more until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned over Saul; and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
<ASV> And I will have mercy on their evil-doing, and I will not keep their sins in mind.
<ASV> Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
<ASV> according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf of you all, because of my having you in the heart, both in my bonds, and  the defence and confirmation of the good news, all of you being fellow-partakers with me of grace.
<ASV> again He doth limit a certain day, `To-day,' (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,'
<ASV> For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, "As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest"; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and I cannot go back.
<ASV> They will say, Peace be with you, and will give you two cakes of bread, which you are to take from them.
<ASV> The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
<ASV> They asked him: Say then, Scibboleth, which is interpreted, An ear of corn. But he answered, Sibboleth, not being able to express an ear of corn by the same letter. Then presently they took him and killed him in the very passage of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim two and forty thousand.
<ASV> Now the people of Beth Shemesh were reaping the wheat harvest in the valley. They lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and they were glad to see it.
<ASV> And Saul said: May God do so and so to me, and add still more: for dying thou shalt die, O Jonathan.
<ASV> if anyhow I may attain to the rising again of the dead.
<ASV> And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.
<ASV> And in the morning the man arose, and opened the door that he might end the journey he had begun: and behold his concubine lay before the door with her hands spread on the threshold.
<ASV> and captureth a young man of the men of Succoth, and asketh him, and he describeth unto him the heads of Succoth, and its elders -- seventy and seven men.
<ASV> That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.
<ASV> If indeed then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for the people had their law given to them in connexion with *it*, what need [was there] still that a different priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be named after the order of Aaron?
<ASV> For if this had been possible, would there not have been an end of those offerings, because the worshippers would have been made completely clean and would have been no longer conscious of sins?
<ASV> But in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins.
<ASV> And the people cometh in unto the camp, and the elders of Israel say, `Why hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? we take unto us from Shiloh the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and it cometh into our midst, and He doth save us out of the hand of our enemies.'
<ASV> And Manoah said, When thy words then come to pass, what shall be the child's manner and his doing?
<ASV> Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
<ASV> Yahweh's angel said to Manoah, "Though you detain me, I won't eat your bread. If you will prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh." For Manoah didn't know that he was Yahweh's angel.
<ASV> And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.
<ASV> And Anna said: I beseech thee, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord: I am that woman who stood before thee here praying to the Lord.
<ASV> Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men went on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, while Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them.
<ASV> And without faith it is not possible to be well-pleasing to him, for it is necessary for anyone who comes to God to have the belief that God is, and that he is a rewarder of all those who make a serious search for him.
<ASV> and she maketh him sleep on her knees, and calleth for a man, and shaveth the seven locks of his head, and beginneth to afflict him, and his power turneth aside from off him;
<ASV> And David goeth, and his men, to Keilah, and fighteth with the Philistines, and leadeth away their cattle, and smiteth among them -- a great smiting, and David saveth the inhabitants of Keilah.
<ASV> And this is an image of the present time; when the offerings which are given are not able to make the heart of the worshipper completely clean,
<ASV> And faith is of things hoped for a confidence, of matters not seen a conviction,
<ASV> And when Gedeon was come to the Jordan, he passed over it with the three hundred men, that were with him: who were so weary that they could not pursue after them that fled.
<ASV> For he looked for a city that hath foundations; whose builder and maker is God.
<ASV> But the angel of the Lord did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the Lord.
<ASV> And all the men of Sichem were gathered together, and all the families of the city of Mello: and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak that stood in Sichem.
<ASV> Went out into the fields, wasting the vineyards, and treading down the grapes: and singing and dancing they went into the temple of their god, and in their banquets and cups they cursed Abimelech.
<ASV> Out of Ephraim  those whose root was in Amalek; After thee was Benjamin among thy peoples. Out of Machir came down governors, And out of Zebulun they that handled the staff of the ruler.
<ASV> The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
<ASV> For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
<ASV> And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament,
<ASV> and ye have forgotten the exhortation that doth speak fully with you as with sons, `My son, be not despising chastening of the Lord, nor be faint, being reproved by Him,
<ASV> Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David, "You shall today be my son-in-law a second time."
<ASV> Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them. So Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
<ASV> Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.
<ASV> Because I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins I will remember no more.
<ASV> And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew of them thirty men, and took their spoil, and gave the changes of garments unto them that explained the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.
<ASV> But the men would not hearken to him; and the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning; and let her go when the morning-dawn arose.
<ASV> whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things.
<ASV> The wise amongst her ladies answer , Yea, she returneth answer to herself,
<ASV> And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:
<ASV> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
<ASV> Then there was terror in the camp, in the open field, and among all the army of the garrison. Even the raiders trembled. The earth shook, and it became a very great panic.
<ASV> And it was clear to Saul that the Lord was with David; and he was loved by all Israel.
<ASV> The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
<ASV> When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man, the Levite; and they turned in thither, and said to him, Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this ? and what hast thou here?
<ASV> He also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel. He lay naked all that day and all night. Therefore they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
<ASV> For I am certain of this very thing, that he by whom the good work was started in you will make it complete till the day of Jesus Christ:
<ASV> and Saul addeth to be afraid of the presence of David yet; and Saul is an enemy with David all the days.
<ASV> And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.
<ASV> Then Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" And David said, "It is my voice, my lord the king."
<ASV> And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
<ASV> For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:
<ASV> The men did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.
<ASV> And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
<ASV> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
<ASV> As they have done from the first, from the day when I took them out of Egypt till this day, turning away from me and worshipping other gods, so now they are acting in the same way to you.
<ASV> So then, rise early in the morning, you and the servants of your lord who came with you. When you rise early in the morning and it is light enough for you, leave.
<ASV> Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.
<ASV> When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in rocks, in tombs, and in pits.
<ASV> And it cometh to pass, at the coming in of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto the camp, that all Israel shout -- a great shout -- and the earth is moved.
<ASV> And when his armourbearer saw this, to wit, that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.
<ASV> Her father said, "I really thought that you hated her, so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please, take her instead."
<ASV> And Saul and all the people that were with him were called together, and they came to the battle; and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, a very great confusion.
<ASV> Now the Philistines got their armies together for war, and came together at Socoh in the land of Judah, and took up their position between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim.
<ASV> And Samuel said to Saul: I will not return with thee, because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
<ASV> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I have considered what Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
<ASV> Then Hannah got up after eating and drinking at Shiloh. (Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the temple of Yahweh.)
<ASV> And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
<ASV> And she bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and the Lord blessed him.
<ASV> The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me: do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.
<ASV> And Jonathan stripped himself of the coat with which he was clothed, and gave it to David, and the rest of his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
<ASV> So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the Lord.
<ASV> Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.
<ASV> And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.
<ASV> and Samson's wife becometh his companion's, who  his friend.
<ASV> Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Lord God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the Lord said, He will come down.
<ASV> He raises up the poor from the dust. From the ash heap he lifts up the needy, to cause them to sit with noble people and to cause them to inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth belong to Yahweh and he has set the inhabited world on them.
<ASV> And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
<ASV> Let your gentleness be known of all men. The Lord  near.
<ASV> And they told David, saying: Behold the Philistines fight against Ceila, and they rob the barns.
<ASV> Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.
<ASV> And the ambush is abiding with her in an inner chamber, and she saith unto him, `Philistines  upon thee, Samson;' and he breaketh the withs as a thread of tow is broken in its smelling fire, and his power hath not been known.
<ASV> And Saul thought, "I will give her to him, so that she may be a snare for him and the hand of the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David, "For a second time you can become my son-in-law today."
<ASV> She said, "I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the journey that you take won't be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into a woman's hand." Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
<ASV> And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
<ASV> They had come to the land of Zuph when Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come and let us return; lest my father give up the asses, and be anxious about us.
<ASV> Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the Lord the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
<ASV> And they arose and came to the house of God, that is, to Silo: and they consulted God, and said: Who shall be in our army the first to go to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the Lord answered them: Let Juda be your leader.
<ASV> And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.
<ASV> And Eliab, his eldest brother, heard while he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
<ASV> Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh Gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, "Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you."
<ASV> And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Manoah, `Of all that I said unto the woman let her take heed;
<ASV> And he said unto them, The Lord is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.
<ASV> And Jehovah said to him, I will certainly be with thee; and thou shalt smite Midian as one man.
<ASV> having confidence of this very thing, that he who has begun in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ's day:
<ASV> And David's young men came, and spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
<ASV> And he said, They were my brethren, the sons of my mother.  Jehovah liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
<ASV> Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David; they had left them behind at the Wadi Besor. They went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. David came near with the people and asked them how they were doing.
<ASV> Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<ASV> Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
<ASV> And Jehovah cometh, and stationeth Himself, and calleth as time by time, `Samuel, Samuel;' and Samuel saith, `Speak, for Thy servant if hearing.'
<ASV> But we have dry grass and food for our asses, as well as bread and wine for me, and for the woman, and for the young man with us: we have no need of anything.
<ASV> Then Saul being angry against Jonathan said to him: Thou son of a woman that is the ravisher of a man, do I not know that thou lovest the son of Isai to thy own confusion and to the confusion of thy shameless mother?
<ASV> And Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him and said, With the end of the staff which is in my hand I tasted a little honey,  behold, I must die!
<ASV> Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the Lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
<ASV> And there went out a man baseborn from the camp of the Philistines named Goliath, of Geth, whose height was six cubits and a span:
<ASV> And by how much [it was] not without the swearing of an oath;
<ASV> And he divideth the three hundred men  three detachments, and putteth trumpets into the hand of all of them, and empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
<ASV> If it goes by the land of Israel to Beth-shemesh, then this great evil is his work; but if not, then we may be certain that the evil was not his doing, but was the working of chance.
<ASV> And they took as wives the daughters of these nations and gave their daughters to their sons, and became servants to their gods.
<ASV> And the people take the provision in their hand, and their trumpets, and every man of Israel he hath sent away, each to his tents; and on the three hundred men he hath kept hold, and the camp of Midian hath been by him at the lower part of the valley.
<ASV> So when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave unto him another heart, and all these things came to pass that day.
<ASV> Warfare was severe against the Philistines all the days of Saul. Whenever Saul saw anyone who was a mighty warrior or any brave man, he conscripted him into his service.
<ASV> That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:
<ASV> that this shall be no stumbling-block to thee, nor offence of heart for my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall deal well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.
<ASV> Then all the corrupt and useless men among the men who went with David reacted and said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not give them anything from the plunder which we recovered, except each man may take his own wife and children. They must take them along and go!"
<ASV> They gave Hebron to Caleb just as Moses said, and he drove out the three sons of Anak from there.
<ASV> The same night the Lord said to him, Up! go down now against their army, for I have given them into your hands.
<ASV> He had thirty sons. He gave his thirty daughters away in marriage outside his clan and brought in from outside thirty young women for his sons. He judged Israel for seven years.
<ASV> And the men of Israel were called together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.
<ASV> And when they were on the way up to the town, they saw some young girls going out to get water and said to them, Is the seer here?
<ASV> to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything—in the first place, his name is translated "king of righteousness," and then also "king of Salem," that is, "king of peace";
<ASV> concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard explanation to say, since ye have become dull of hearing,
<ASV> While it is said, To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation.
<ASV> Now every high priest is given authority to take to God the things which are given and to make offerings; so that it is necessary for this man, like them, to have something for an offering.
<ASV> and also unto their judges they have not hearkened, but have gone a-whoring after other gods, and bow themselves to them; they have turned aside  haste out of the way  which their fathers walked to obey the commands of Jehovah -- they have not done so.
<ASV> For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.
<ASV> So David received from her hand that which she had brought him. Then he said to her, "Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice, and have granted your request."
<ASV> And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;
<ASV> Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had worked wonderfully among them, didn't they let the people go, and they departed?
<ASV> So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
<ASV> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, and in all freedom, as always, also now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death,
<ASV> And they took the victuals of the people in their hand, and their trumpets; and all the men of Israel he sent away, every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
<ASV> Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side." But he didn't tell his father.
<ASV> And Barak saith unto her, `If thou dost go with me, then I have gone; and if thou dost not go with me, I do not go;'
<ASV> And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.
<ASV> and now, what is there under thy hand? five loaves give into my hand, or that which is found.'
<ASV> But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn't go over the brook Besor.
<ASV> And they returned to their brethren in Saraa and Esthaol, who asked them what they had done? to whom they answered:
<ASV> Jehovah therefore shall be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and do me justice [in delivering me] out of thy hand.
<ASV> And He smiteth among the men of Beth-Shemesh, for they looked into the ark of Jehovah, yea, He smiteth among the people seventy men -- fifty chief men; and the people mourn, because Jehovah smote among the people -- a great smiting.
<ASV> And Saul's servants said these things to David. And David said, Does it seem to you a small thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, of no great name?
<ASV> So then, my loved ones, as you have at all times done what I say, not only when I am present, but now much more when I am not with you, give yourselves to working out your salvation with fear in your hearts;
<ASV> Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel."
<ASV> Then the Lord sent sudden fear on Benjamin before Israel; and that day the children of Israel put to death twenty-five thousand, one hundred men of Benjamin, all of them swordsmen.
<ASV> And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all the chariots, and all the army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera got down from  chariot, and fled on foot.
<ASV> And, truly, the good news came to us, even as it did to them; but the hearing of the word did them no good, because they were not united in faith with the true hearers.
<ASV> And the land rested forty years, and Othoniel the son of Cenez died.
<ASV> And when they that remained of Benjamin saw this, they fled into the wilderness and made towards the rock that is called Remmon. In that flight, also as they were straggling and going different ways, they slew of them five thousand men. And as they went farther, they still pursued them, and slew also other two thousand.
<ASV> saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in  midst of  assembly will I sing thy praises.
<ASV> But his wife said to him, "If Yahweh were pleased to kill us, he wouldn't have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, and he wouldn't he have shown us all these things, nor would he have told us such things as these at this time."
<ASV> Now faith is  substantiating of things hoped for,  conviction of things not seen.
<ASV> And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him: thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
<ASV> For God is my witness, how my love goes out to you all in the loving mercies of Christ Jesus.
<ASV> and the land resteth forty years. And Othniel son of Kenaz dieth,
<ASV> And Manasseh hath not occupied Beth-Shean and its towns, and Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Iblaim and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, and the Canaanite is desirous to dwell in that land;
<ASV> And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were found with him, about six hundred men.
<ASV> Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
<ASV> Hannah prayed, and said: "My heart exults in Yahweh! My horn is exalted in Yahweh. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation.
<ASV> Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;
<ASV> For I thy servant have killed both a lion and a bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be also as one of them. I will go now, and take away the reproach of the people: for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, who hath dared to curse the army of the living God?
<ASV> And Samuel saith unto him, `Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee to-day, and given it to thy neighbour who is better than thou;
<ASV> Then she said, The Philistines are on you, Samson. And awaking from his sleep, he said, I will go out as at other times, shaking myself free. But he was not conscious that the Lord had gone from him.
<ASV> Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body, for he had many wives.
<ASV> When he had set the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.
<ASV> And David was the youngest: and the three oldest were with Saul's army.
<ASV> Seeing that we may not give them our daughters as wives? For the children of Israel had taken an oath, saying, Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.
<ASV> and the haft also went in after the blade, and the fat closed upon the blade; for he did not draw the sword out of his belly, and it came out between the legs.
<ASV> So David received of her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
<ASV> The brook Kishon swept them away, The brook most ancient -- the brook Kishon. Thou dost tread down strength, O my soul!
<ASV> And Saul and the men of Israel came together and took up their position in the valley of Elah, and put their forces in order against the Philistines.
<ASV> and Benjamin turneth back at that time, and they give to them the women whom they have kept alive of the women of Jabesh-Gilead, and they have not found for [all of] them so.
<ASV> The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; then the ambushers spread out, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.
<ASV> him, indeed, therefore, I hope to send, when I may see through the things concerning me -- immediately;
<ASV> A man who disregards Moses' law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses.
<ASV> Now when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he went down with an ephod in his hand.
<ASV> Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, "Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves!"
<ASV> And Jehovah was with Judah; and he took possession of the hill-country, for he did not dispossess the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
<ASV> And when he came to Lehi, the Philistines came out, meeting him with loud cries; then the spirit of the Lord came rushing on him, and the cords on his arms became like grass which has been burned with fire, and the bands came falling off his hands.
<ASV> `And if ye do not hearken to the voice of Jehovah -- then ye have provoked the mouth of Jehovah, and the hand of Jehovah hath been against you, and against your fathers.
<ASV> Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
<ASV> When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters were taken captive.
<ASV> And the sons of Israel rise in the morning, and encamp against Gibeah,
<ASV> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
<ASV> And Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye, Gilead, ye are fugitives of Ephraim in the midst of Ephraim,  in the midst of Manasseh.
<ASV> And there was a man at Maon, whose business was at Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep at Carmel.
<ASV> And his father went down to the woman, and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
<ASV> Then his father and mother said to him, Is there no woman among the daughters of your relations or among all my people, that you have to go for your wife to the Philistines, who are without circumcision? But Samson said to his father, Get her for me, for she is pleasing to me.
<ASV> Ye may not cast away, then, your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward,
<ASV> Then David said, O Lord, the God of Israel, news has been given to your servant that it is Saul's purpose to come to Keilah and send destruction on the town because of me.
<ASV> and Samuel saith, `Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I pray for you unto Jehovah.'
<ASV> then he has said, "Behold, I have come to do your will." He takes away the first in order to establish the second,
<ASV> The Philistines took God's ark, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
<ASV> He said to his men, "Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh's anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, since he is Yahweh's anointed."
<ASV> Then Samuel went up from Gilgal and the rest of the people went up after Saul against the men of war, and they came from Gilgal to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin: and Saul took the number of the people who were with him, about six hundred men.
<ASV> Have no cares; but in everything with prayer and praise put your requests before God.
<ASV> Neither by the blood of goats, or of calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the holies, having obtained eternal redemption.
<ASV> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: who strengthened against them Eglon king of Moab: because they did evil in his sight.
<ASV> The men who did not die were struck with the tumors, so that the cry of the city for help went up to heaven.
<ASV> So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.
<ASV> And there was no deliverer, for it was far from Zidon, and they had nothing to do with  man; and it  in the valley that is by Beth-rehob. And they built the city and dwelt therein.
<ASV> David said to Abishai, "Don't destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against Yahweh's anointed, and be guiltless?"
<ASV> She is to have nothing which comes from the vine for her food, and let her take no wine or strong drink or anything which is unclean; let her take care to do all I have given her orders to do.
<ASV> And the lords of the Philistines marched with their hundreds and their thousands: but David and his men were in the rear with Achis.
<ASV> He will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive trees and will give them to his servants.
<ASV> So the Philistines took him and put out his eyes; then they took him down to Gaza, and, chaining him with bands of brass, put him to work crushing grain in the prison-house.
<ASV> Samson's wife wept before him, and said, "You just hate me, and don't love me. You've told a riddle to the children of my people, and haven't told it to me." He said to her, "Behold, I haven't told my father or my mother, so why should I tell you?"
<ASV> And when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him.
<ASV> Then they said to him, Now say Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth, and was not able to say it in the right way; then they took him and put him to death at the crossing-places of Jordan; and at that time forty-two thousand Ephraimites were put to death.
<ASV> But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
<ASV> And after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the holy of holies:
<ASV> David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.
<ASV> And the woman came and told her husband, saying, "A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him from where he came, and he did not tell me his name.
<ASV> and he sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem, and behold, they shut up the city against thee;
<ASV> For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
<ASV> And David went in flight from Naioth in Ramah and came to Jonathan and said, What have I done? What is my crime and my sin against your father that he is attempting to take my life?
<ASV> If only this people were in my command! Then I would remove Abimelech, and I would have said, 'Increase your army and come out!'"
<ASV> And he called unto him Zabulon and Nepbtali, and went up with ten thousand fighting men, having Debbora in his company.
<ASV> And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
<ASV> Jephthah said to them, "I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you didn't save me out of their hand.
<ASV> for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him.
<ASV> Then the Philistines seized upon him, and forthwith pulled out his eyes, and led him bound in chains to Gaza, and shutting him up in prison made him grind.
<ASV> And again he says, I will put my faith in him. And again, See, I am here, and the children which God has given to me.
<ASV> And the Levites took down the ark of God, and the little box that was at the side of it, wherein were the vessels of gold, and they put them upon the great stone. The men also of Bethsames offered holocausts and sacrificed victims that day to the Lord.
<ASV> When Saul realized that Yahweh was with David and his own daughter Michal loved him,
<ASV> And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken: and David recovered his two wives.
<ASV> and he thirsteth exceedingly, and calleth unto Jehovah, and saith, `Thou -- Thou hast given by the hand of Thy servant this great salvation; and now, I die with thirst, and have fallen into the hand of the uncircumcised.'
<ASV> So Samuel did what Yahweh said. He came to Bethlehem, and the elders of the city came trembling to meet him. They said, "Have you come in peace?"
<ASV> Wo to us, who doth deliver us out of the hand of these honourable gods? these  the gods who are smiting the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.
<ASV> Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel." But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel.
<ASV> And David was the youngest; and the three eldest had followed Saul.
<ASV> And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:
<ASV> Then Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right hip, and thrust it into his belly;
<ASV> And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
<ASV> in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the world,
<ASV> When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
<ASV> So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.
<ASV> Then Jonathan sent for David and gave him word of all these things. And Jonathan took David to Saul, who kept him by his side as in the past.
<ASV> Of the angels he says, "Who makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire."
<ASV> And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson! And he awoke out of his sleep, and tore out the pin of the beam, and the web.
<ASV> And Samson said to them, If ye act thus, for a certainty I will avenge myself on you, and then I will cease.
<ASV> And because she nagged him day after day with her words, and pestered him, his soul grew impatient to the point of death.
<ASV> The Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and they served the Baals.
<ASV> But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, "On this condition I will make a treaty with you, by gouging out the right eye of each of you, so that I can make it a disgrace for all Israel."
<ASV> And the sons of Benjamin see that they have been smitten -- and the men of Israel give place to Benjamin, for they have trusted unto the ambush which they had set against Gibeah,
<ASV> And Joshua let the people go away, and the children of Israel went, every man to his heritage, to take the land for themselves.
<ASV> But David abode in the desert in strong holds, and he remained in a mountain of the desert of Ziph, in a woody hill. And Saul sought him always: but the Lord delivered him not into his hands.
<ASV> But the hand of the Lord was hard on the people of Ashdod and he sent disease on them through all the country of Ashdod.
<ASV> By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.
<ASV> And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David made haste to get away from Saul; and Saul and his men sought to surround David and his men to take them.
<ASV> And Eli answereth and saith, `Go in peace, and the God of Israel doth give thy petition which thou hast asked of Him.'
<ASV> On the next day the people rose early, and they built there an altar and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.
<ASV> For if the blood of goats and bulls, and a heifer's ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh,
<ASV> whose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens."
<ASV> Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, because we have sworn, the two of us, an oath in the name of Yahweh, saying, "Yahweh will be between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring forever." Then he got up and left, and Jonathan went into the city.
<ASV> And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he said: Behold this nation hath made void my covenant, which I had made with their fathers, and hath despised to hearken to my voice:
<ASV> The Zidonians also, and Amalek and Maon oppressed you, and ye cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand.
<ASV> The stem of his spear was as long as a cloth-worker's rod, and its head was made of six hundred shekels' weight of iron: and one went before him with his body-cover.
<ASV> [And it was told] the Gazathites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they surrounded , and laid wait for him all night at the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning light we will kill him.
<ASV> And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at the other times.
<ASV> No other is holy as the Lord, for there is no other God but you: there is no Rock like our God.
<ASV> And there came an angel of the Lord, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
<ASV> And Samuel saith unto Jesse, `Are the young men finished?' and he saith, `Yet hath been left the youngest; and lo, he delighteth himself among the flock;' and Samuel saith unto Jesse, `Send and take him, for we do not turn round till his coming in hither.'
<ASV> And Jonathan saith unto David, `Jehovah, God of Israel -- when I search my father, about  time to-morrow  the third , and lo, good  towards David, and I do not then send unto thee, and have uncovered thine ear --
<ASV> You put all things under his feet. For in making man the ruler over all things, God did not put anything outside his authority; though we do not see everything under him now.
<ASV> And the messenger answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
<ASV> Now when she came to him, he put into her mind the idea of requesting a field from her father: and she got down from her ass; and Caleb said to her, What is it?
<ASV> Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made an attack on the South and on Ziklag, and had overcome Ziklag and put it on fire;
<ASV> (Now all the people of the land used to go into the forest, for there was honey on the surface of the ground.)
<ASV> But his wife said to him, If the Lord was purposing our death, he would not have taken our burned offering and our meal offering, or have given us such orders about the child.
<ASV> Now therefore your king is here, whom you have chosen and desired: Behold the Lord hath given you a king.
<ASV> They answered and said to them: He is: behold he is before you, make haste now: for he came to day into the city, for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place.
<ASV> So the day following the people went out into the field. And it was told Abimelech.
<ASV> He sent it to those who were in Bethel, to those who were in Ramoth of the South, to those who were in Jattir,
<ASV> as saith the simile of the ancients, From the wicked goeth out wickedness, and my hand is not on thee.
<ASV> Now I want you to know, brothers, that my circumstances have happened instead for the progress of the gospel,
<ASV> but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.
<ASV> And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord and became servants to the Baals;
<ASV> And the princes of the Philistines bring up to her seven green withs which have not been dried, and she bindeth him with them.
<ASV> He will appoint them to him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will assign some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.
<ASV> And David said to Saul: Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, or a bear, and took a ram out of the midst of the flock:
<ASV> In the which will, we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once.
<ASV> Then Saul swore to her by Yahweh, "As Yahweh lives, you will not be punished for this thing."
<ASV> Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?
<ASV> And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.
<ASV> And the five lords of the Philistines saw , and returned to Ekron the same day.
<ASV> And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
<ASV> the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
<ASV> And they gave the town the name of Dan, after Dan their father, who was the son of Israel: though the town had been named Laish at first.
<ASV> And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having with him three thousand chosen men of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
<ASV> One of the servants answered and said, "Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing a stringed instrument, a brave man, a warrior, prudent in speech, and handsome. And Yahweh is with him."
<ASV> By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
<ASV> And Saul taketh three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and goeth to seek David and his men, on the front of the rocks of the wild goats,
<ASV> God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
<ASV> And he said to his wife: We shall certainly die, because we have seen God.
<ASV> So they sent representatives to Saul's town Gibeah, and these gave the news to the people: and all the people gave themselves to weeping.
<ASV> so he took the army and divided them into three divisions, and he laid an ambush in the field. And he saw the people were coming out from the city, and he arose against them and killed them.
<ASV> and David saith unto Saul, `Let no man's heart fall because of him, thy servant doth go, and hath fought with this Philistine.'
<ASV> Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account, so that they can do this with joy and not with groaning, for this would be unprofitable for you.
<ASV> Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.
<ASV> David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.
<ASV> Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, "Send me David your son, who is with the sheep."
<ASV> And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.
<ASV> And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come out to me with sticks? And the Philistine put curses on David by all his gods.
<ASV> And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
<ASV> The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand.
<ASV> Thou shalt not take away thy kindness from my house for ever, when the Lord shall have rooted out the enemies of David, every one of them from the earth, may he take away Jonathan from his house, and may the Lord require it at the hands of David's enemies.
<ASV> And the descendants of Benjamin were gathered from the cities to Gibeah to go out for battle against the Israelites.
<ASV> But six hundred turned and fled toward the wilderness, to the rock of Rimmon, and they remained at the rock of Rimmon for four months.
<ASV> And he maketh a force, and smiteth Amalek, and delivereth Israel out of the hand of its spoiler.
<ASV> And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
<ASV> So now, get up by night, you and your people, and keep watch in the field secretly;
<ASV> He inquired of Yahweh for him, gave him food, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
<ASV> Holocausts for sin did not please thee.
<ASV> And Saul said to his uncle, He told us for certain that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he told him not.
<ASV> And Deborah saith unto Barak, `Rise, for this  the day in which Jehovah hath given Sisera into thy hand; hath not Jehovah gone out before thee?' And Barak goeth down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
<ASV> Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the Lord, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.
<ASV> She should not eat of anything that comes from the vine, or drink wine or strong drink, or eat anything unclean; she should keep all that I commanded."
<ASV> And Jerubbaal (he  Gideon) riseth early, and all the people who  with him, and they encamp by the well of Harod, and the camp of Midian hath been on the south of him, on the height of Moreh, in the valley.
<ASV> As the Lord liveth who is the saviour of Israel, if it was done by Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. In this none of the people gainsaid him.
<ASV> Then Jonathan said, "Far be it from you! For if I know for certain that my father decided evil should come upon you, would I not have told it to you?"
<ASV> And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child and near the time when she would give birth; and when she had the news that the ark of God had been taken and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, her pains came on her suddenly and she gave birth.
<ASV> And Saul said, Bring hither to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings. And he offered up the burnt-offering.
<ASV> How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? which having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.
<ASV> so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole praetorium, and to the other places -- all,
<ASV> Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt.
<ASV> Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the Lord liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.
<ASV> For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
<ASV> Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best plunder.
<ASV> Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:
<ASV> His mother looked out at a window, and howled: and she spoke from the dining room: Why is his chariot so long in coming back? Why are the feet of his horses so slow?
<ASV> And when David turneth back from smiting the Philistine, then Abner taketh him and bringeth him in before Saul, and the head of the Philistine in his hand;
<ASV> Though some are preaching Christ out of envy and competition, others do it out of a good heart:
<ASV> Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
<ASV> And he died, and was buried in Zabulon.
<ASV> As soon as Gideon was dead, the children of Israel turned again, and played the prostitute following the Baals, and made Baal Berith their god.
<ASV> And the anger of Yahweh burned against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and the Ammonites.
<ASV> And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, who destroyed out of it the three sons of Enac.
<ASV> and not only while I am alive dost thou do with me the kindness of Jehovah, and I die not,
<ASV> Let brotherly love continue.
<ASV> And the men of Israel had made a turn about, and the men of Benjamin were overcome with fear, for they saw that evil had overtaken them.
<ASV> Then Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son!" And he said, "Here I am."
<ASV> Therefore I was displeased with that generation, and said, 'They always err in their heart, but they didn't know my ways;'
<ASV> And it cometh to pass, at that time, that Eli is lying down in his place, and his eyes have begun to be dim -- he is not able to see.
<ASV> And the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying:
<ASV> There was a certain man from Ramathaim Zophim, from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
<ASV> And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
<ASV> So then, be careful and do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean,
<ASV> Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and is a rewarder of those who seek him.
<ASV> Here I am. Witness against me before Yahweh, and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Of whose hand have I taken a ransom to make me blind my eyes? I will restore it to you."
<ASV> And Samson went down to Timnathah, and saw a woman in Timnathah of the daughters of the Philistines.
<ASV> and Jonathan calleth after the youth, `Speed, haste, stand not;' and Jonathan's youth gathereth the arrows, and cometh unto his lord.
<ASV> They said, "If you are sending the ark of the God of Israel away, you must not send it away empty, but by all means return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will become known to you why his hand is not turned aside from you."
<ASV> And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.
<ASV> Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring, for he had many wives.
<ASV> Gideon said, "Well then, when Yahweh gives Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will trample your flesh with the thorns and briers of the wilderness."
<ASV> One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
<ASV> For yet a very little while he that comes will come, and will not delay.
<ASV> When the ark of Yahweh's covenant came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
<ASV> And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.
<ASV> And the day cometh that Jonathan son of Saul saith unto the young man bearing his weapons, `Come, and we pass over unto the station of the Philistines, which  on the other side of this;' and to his father he hath not declared .
<ASV> I will place a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and all of the ground is dry, I will know that you will deliver Israel by my hand, just as you have said."
<ASV> David was told, "Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors."
<ASV> And David's men said to him, Even here in Judah we are full of fear: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
<ASV> but I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-workman and fellow-soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need,
<ASV> Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
<ASV> And it cometh to pass in the morning, when the wine is gone out from Nabal, that his wife declareth to him these things, and his heart dieth within him, and he hath been as a stone.
<ASV> choosing rather to suffer affliction along with the people of God than to have  temporary pleasure of sin;
<ASV> For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,
<ASV> How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
<ASV> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
<ASV> And all the people went to Galgal, and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Galgal, and they sacrificed there victims of peace before the Lord. And there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced exceedingly.
<ASV> David said to him, "Will you bring me down to this troop?" He said, "Swear to me by God that you will not kill me and not deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop."
<ASV> yea, he putteth his life in his hand, and smiteth the Philistine, and Jehovah worketh a great salvation for all Israel; thou hast seen, and dost rejoice, and why dost thou sin against innocent blood, to put David to death for nought?'
<ASV> Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
<ASV> And Samuel answereth Saul and saith, `I  the seer; go up before me into the high place, and ye have eaten with me to-day, and I have sent thee away in the morning, and all that  in thy heart I declare to thee.
<ASV> And three bands of men came out from the Philistines to make an attack; one band went by the road which goes to Ophrah, into the land of Shual:
<ASV> But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
<ASV> Say no more words of pride; let not uncontrolled sayings come out of your mouths: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, by him acts are judged.
<ASV> Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ; To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers  and servants:
<ASV> And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?
<ASV> And Saul saith unto Jehovah, God of Israel, `Give perfection;' and Jonathan and Saul are captured, and the people went out.
<ASV> And they immolated a calf, and offered the child to Heli.
<ASV> And blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you who have prevented me this day from bloodguilt and from delivering myself by my own hand.
<ASV> Saul answered, "Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me like this?"
<ASV> For every high priest taken from amongst men is established for men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;
<ASV> Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
<ASV> And Saul caught up a spear to strike him. And Jonathan understood that it was determined by his father to kill David.
<ASV> But the Asherites went on living among the Canaanites, the people of the land, without driving them out.
<ASV> In the measure of my strong hope and belief that in nothing will I be put to shame, but that without fear, as at all times, so now will Christ have glory in my body, by life or by death.
<ASV> Of the doctrine of baptisms, and imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
<ASV> And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.
<ASV> And the land had rest forty years; and Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
<ASV> One of the same place answered, "Who is their father?" Therefore it became a proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
<ASV> See, may ye not refuse him who is speaking, for if those did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely speaking -- much less we who do turn away from him who  from heaven,
<ASV> For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the statement of the oath, after the law, appoints a Son, who is made perfect forever.
<ASV> And they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked Jehovah to anger.
<ASV> So David said to Ahimelech the priest, "The king charged me with a matter and said to me, 'No one must know anything about this matter on which I am sending you, with which I have charged you and the servants.'" So I have arranged to meet with my servants at a certain place.
<ASV> For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives.
<ASV> and Jehovah selleth them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who hath reigned in Hazor, and the head of his host  Sisera, and he is dwelling in Harosheth of the Goyim;
<ASV> Where the chariots were dashed together, and the army of the enemies was choked, there let the justices of the Lord be rehearsed, and his clemency towards the brave men of Israel: then the people of the Lord went down to the gates, and obtained the sovereignty.
<ASV> And Deborah singeth -- also Barak son of Abinoam -- on that day, saying: --
<ASV> and blessed  thy discretion, and blessed  thou in that thou hast restrained me this day from coming in with blood, and to restrain my hand to myself.
<ASV> And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the Lord? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.
<ASV> They said to him, "Please ask counsel of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous."
<ASV> You have explained to me today that you have dealt well with me, how Yahweh delivered me into your hand but you did not kill me.
<ASV> Why should you harden your hearts like the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? Is it not just like when he dealt with them wantonly so that they sent them away and they left?
<ASV> and might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage.
<ASV> Then the five men who had gone to make a search through the country of Laish, said to their brothers, Have you knowledge that in these houses there is an ephod and family gods and a pictured image and a metal image? So now you see what to do.
<ASV> But call to mind the earlier days in which, having been enlightened, ye endured much conflict of sufferings;
<ASV> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.
<ASV> and the men that died not were smitten with the hemorrhoids; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
<ASV> Then Jonathan said to David, Whatever your desire is, I will do it for you.
<ASV> And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.
<ASV> For consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself, that ye be not weary, fainting in your minds.
<ASV> As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.
<ASV> As many, therefore, as  perfect -- let us think this, and if  anything ye think otherwise, this also shall God reveal to you,
<ASV> For Israel had put themselves in array, and the Philistines who stood against them were prepared.
<ASV> And when they got up to go away, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, Now evening is coming on, so do not go tonight; see, the day is almost gone; take your rest here and let your heart be glad, and tomorrow early, go on your way back to your house.
<ASV> Saul's uncle said, "Please tell me what Samuel said to you."
<ASV> But now he has attained a more excellent ministry, by as much as he is also mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted upon better promises.
<ASV> Then the woman came in, and said to her husband, A man came to me, and his form was like the form of a god, causing great fear; I put no question to him about where he came from, and he did not give me his name;
<ASV> And the Levites have taken down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer which  with it, in which  the vessels of gold, and place  on the great stone; and the men of Beth-Shemesh have caused to ascend burnt-offerings and sacrifice sacrifices in that day to Jehovah;
<ASV> and so fearful was the appearance that Moses said, "I am terrified and trembling."
<ASV> But the upright man will be living by his faith; and if he goes back, my soul will have no pleasure in him.
<ASV> And again, the Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. They served the Baals, the Ashtaroth, the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab, and the gods of the Ammonites and Philistines; they abandoned Yahweh and did not serve him.
<ASV> And the people, the men of Israel, strengthen themselves, and add to set the battle in array in the place where they arranged themselves on the first day.
<ASV> And they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.
<ASV> And Samuel saith, `And why dost thou ask me, and Jehovah hath turned aside from thee, and is thine enemy?
<ASV> And it came to pass when Samuel was old, that he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel.
<ASV> And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
<ASV> And it was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
<ASV> And all Midian and Amalek and the sons of the east have been gathered together, and pass over, and encamp in the valley of Jezreel,
<ASV> And they went out into their fields and got in the fruit of their vines, and when the grapes had been crushed, they made a holy feast and went into the house of their god, and over their food and drink they were cursing Abimelech.
<ASV> And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.
<ASV> And Saul's servants spoke these words to David privately. But David said, "Is it insignificant in your sight to become the son-in-law of the king, as I am a poor and lightly esteemed man?"
<ASV> Jephthah said to the elders, "Did you not shun me and drive me out from the house of my father? Why do you come to me now when you have trouble?"
<ASV> and a helmet of brass  on his head, and  a scaled coat of mail he  clothed, and the weight of the coat of mail  five thousand shekels of brass,
<ASV> And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art acceptable to me, as an angel of God; nevertheless the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
<ASV> Saul was threatened by David still more, so Saul became a perpetual enemy of David.
<ASV> Yahweh said to him, "Peace be to you! Don't be afraid. You shall not die."
<ASV> And David answering, said: Behold the king's spear: let one of the king's servants come over and fetch it.
<ASV> Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.
<ASV> Now Eli was very old; and he had news from time to time of what his sons were doing to all Israel.
<ASV> And he said: If I have found grace before thee, give me a sign that it is thou that speakest to me,
<ASV> But David fled from Najoth, which is in Ramatha, and came and said to Jonathan: What have I done? what is my iniquity, and what is my sin against thy father, that he seeketh my life?
<ASV> But ye have forsaken me, and served other gods; therefore I will save you no more.
<ASV> Then they put the ark of Yahweh on the utility cart with the container holding the gold mice and the images of their tumors.
<ASV> and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah, and Jehovah raiseth a saviour to the sons of Israel, and he saveth them -- Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother;
<ASV> For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.
<ASV> And after hearing what they are saying, you will get strength to go down against the army. So he went down with his servant Purah to the outer line of the tents of the armed men.
<ASV> And Saul, conscious that the voice was David's, said, Is that your voice, David, my son? And David said, It is my voice, O my lord king.
<ASV> When she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, his soul was troubled to death.
<ASV> And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
<ASV> And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.
<ASV> And when David had heard that Nabal was dead, he said: Blessed be the Lord, who hath judged the cause of my reproach at the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil, and the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his head. Then David sent and treated with Abigail, that he might take her to himself for a wife.
<ASV> And the princes of Galaad said to Jephte: For this cause we are now come to thee, that thou mayst go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be head over all the inhabitants of Galaad.
<ASV> And Jehovah the God of Israel gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them; and Israel took possession of the whole land of the Amorites, who dwelt in that country.
<ASV> including Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people didn't know that Jonathan was gone.
<ASV> Furthermore, we have had our earthly fathers who disciplined us, and we respected them. Will we not much rather subject ourselves to the Father of spirits and live?
<ASV> The men of Israel were to make a turn about in the fight. And Benjamin had overcome and put to death about thirty of the men of Israel, and were saying, Certainly they are falling back before us as in the first fight.
<ASV> and call the name of the city Dan, by the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; and yet Laish  the name of the city at the first.
<ASV> And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,
<ASV> Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were in Nob; and they all came to the king.
<ASV> By faith, Noah, oracularly warned concerning things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which  according to faith.
<ASV> Because where there is a testament, there has to be the death of the man who made it.
<ASV> David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah the brother of Joab, saying, "Who will go down with me to Saul, in the camp?" And Abishai said, "I will go down with you."
<ASV> And when he had brought him, behold they were lying spread upon all the ground, eating and drinking, and as it were keeping a festival day, for all the prey, and the spoils which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Juda.
<ASV> For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
<ASV> and to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men went about.
<ASV> and therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli: the iniquity of the house of Eli is not atoned for, by sacrifice, and by offering -- unto the age.'
<ASV> Then Gideon said, Because of this, when the Lord has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands, I will have you stretched on a bed of thorns of the waste land and on sharp stems, and have you crushed as grain is crushed on a grain-floor.
<ASV> And Saul saith, `Bring nigh unto me the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings;' and he causeth the burnt-offering to ascend.
<ASV> And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
<ASV> Then Abigail went to Nabal, and look, he was holding a feast in his house like the feast of the king. Nabal was enjoying himself, and he was very drunk, so she did not tell him a thing, nothing at all, until the light of morning.
<ASV> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, a hundred and ten years old.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
<ASV> And they turn aside thither, and come in unto the house of the young man the Levite, the house of Micah, and ask of him of welfare, --
<ASV> When the trumpet shall sound in my hand, do you also blow the trumpets on every side of the camp.
<ASV> And Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy, and said to him, Take these and go back to the town.
<ASV> they said to him, "Please say Shibboleth," and if he said, "Sibboleth"—because he could not pronounce it correctly—they grabbed him and executed him at the fords of Jordan. At that time forty-two thousand from Ephraim fell.
<ASV> And all Israel were gathered together against the city, as one man, with one mind, and one counsel:
<ASV> Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times, accomplishing the services;
<ASV> But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?
<ASV> and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and will speak of thee with my father: and see what it is, and tell thee.
<ASV> And they said to the messengers that had come, Thus shall ye say to the men of Jabesh-Gilead: To-morrow ye shall have deliverance when the sun is hot. And the messengers came and informed the men of Jabesh-Gilead; and they were glad.
<ASV> Keep in mind those who were over you, and who gave you the word of God; seeing the outcome of their way of life, let your faith be like theirs.
<ASV> Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:
<ASV> And he had a son whose name was Saul, a choice and goodly man, and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he appeared above all the people.
<ASV> Swear now therefore to me by Jehovah, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.
<ASV> And David said to Achish, But what have I done? what have you seen in your servant while I have been with you till this day, that I may not go and take up arms against those who are now making war on my lord the king?
<ASV> Now there was no iron-worker in all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, For fear the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears:
<ASV> And Jonathan again took an oath to David, because of his love for him: for David was as dear to him as his very soul.
<ASV> The children of the Kenite, Moses' brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.
<ASV> So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
<ASV> And his sons walked not in his ways: but they turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
<ASV> Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these were men of valor.
<ASV> And she saith, `Let thy handmaid find grace in thine eyes;' and the woman goeth on her way, and eateth, and her countenance hath not been  for it any more.
<ASV> And Samuel saith unto Saul, `Me did Jehovah send to anoint thee for king over His people, over Israel; and now, hearken to the voice of the words of Jehovah:
<ASV> Now at the present time, men over whom death has power take the tenth; but then it was taken by one of whom it is witnessed that he is living.
<ASV> And the children of Benjamin who came that day from the towns were twenty-six thousand men armed with swords, in addition to the people of Gibeah, numbering seven hundred of the best fighting-men,
<ASV> And Israel sent men to Sihon, king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let me now go through your land to my place.
<ASV> And now, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If Jehovah have moved thee against me, let him accept an oblation; but if the sons of men, cursed be they before Jehovah; for they have driven me out this day from adhering to the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.
<ASV> and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of sayings, which those having heard did entreat that a word might not be added to them,
<ASV> yea, these have entered the house of Micah, and take the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest saith unto them, `What are ye doing?'
<ASV> She said, "The glory has departed from Israel; for God's ark has been taken."
<ASV> And the men of Israel go out from Mizpeh, and pursue the Philistines, and smite them unto the place of Beth-Car.
<ASV> Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take plunder among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them." They said, "Do whatever seems good to you." Then the priest said, "Let us draw near here to God."
<ASV> for our God is a consuming fire.
<ASV> Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.
<ASV> Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob,
<ASV> And the children of Benjamin went forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty-two thousand men.
<ASV> and, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, who received tithes, has been made to pay tithes.
<ASV> And the princes of the Philistines went forth: and from the beginning of their going forth, David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul, and his name became very famous.
<ASV> And thou hast shewn this day what good things thou hast done to me: how the Lord delivered me into thy hand, and thou hast not killed me.
<ASV> By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
<ASV> Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead.
<ASV> And all Israel was very sorry, and repented for the destroying of one tribe out of Israel.
<ASV> The woman bore a son, and named him Samson. The child grew, and Yahweh blessed him.
<ASV> And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?
<ASV> whence not even the first apart from blood hath been initiated,
<ASV> `And thou hast gone down before me to Gilgal, and lo, I am going down unto thee, to cause to ascend burnt-offerings, to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings; seven days thou dost wait till my coming in unto thee, and I have made known to thee that which thou dost do.'
<ASV> And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
<ASV> And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things; and his heart died within him, and he became  a stone.
<ASV> But Madian and Amalec, and all the eastern people lay scattered in the valley, as a multitude of locusts: their camels also were innumerable as the sand that lieth on the sea shore.
<ASV> And Jehovah saved Israel that day; and the battle passed over beyond Beth-Aven.
<ASV> And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
<ASV> They would camp against them and destroy the produce of the land as far as Gaza; they left no produce in Israel, or sheep, ox, or donkey.
<ASV> And the hand of the Israelites pressed harder and harder on Jabin king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
<ASV> And a messenger of Jehovah goeth up from Gilgal unto Bochim,
<ASV> And Josue the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being a hundred and ten years old,
<ASV> The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.
<ASV> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old.
<ASV> The men of Israel said, "Have you seen this man who has come up? He has surely come up to defy Israel. The king will give great riches to the man who kills him, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel."
<ASV> And Ephraim did not dispossess the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt among them in Gezer.
<ASV> but I trust in  Lord that I myself also shall soon come;
<ASV> He answered them: They were my brethren, the sons of my mother. As the Lord liveth, if you had saved them, I would not kill you.
<ASV> therefore I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not yet implored the face of Yahweh.' So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering."
<ASV> So the Lord sent Jerubbaal and Barak and Jephthah and Samuel and took you out of the power of those who were fighting against you on every side, and made you safe.
<ASV> to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, `King of righteousness,' and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)
<ASV> And Jonathan said to David, Come and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
<ASV> And Manoah maketh entreaty unto Jehovah, and saith, `O, my Lord, the man of God whom Thou didst send, let him come in, I pray thee, again unto us, and direct us what we do to the youth who is born.'
<ASV> And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
<ASV> For otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the ones who worship, having been purified once and for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?
<ASV> For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.
<ASV> the one, indeed, of rivalry the Christ do proclaim, not purely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds,
<ASV> Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things.
<ASV> In those days there was no king in Israel, but every one did that which seemed right to himself.
<ASV> Because he was still in his father's body when Melchizedek came to him.
<ASV> And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
<ASV> For who when he hath found his enemy, will let him go well away? But the Lord reward thee for this good turn, for what thou hast done to me this day.
<ASV> For Hannah's prayer came from her heart, and though her lips were moving she made no sound: so it seemed to Eli that she was overcome with wine.
<ASV> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers. Then Yahweh's Spirit came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.
<ASV> I went out after him, and overcame him, and took it out of his mouth: and if, turning on me, he came at me, I took him by the hair and overcame him and put him to death.
<ASV> And Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
<ASV> The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
<ASV> He had brass shin armor on his legs, and a brass javelin between his shoulders.
<ASV> Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
<ASV> And a man of that place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
<ASV> And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered; and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
<ASV> And from that day Saul was looking with envy on David.
<ASV> And they said to him, Be quiet; say nothing, and come with us and be our father and priest; is it better for you to be priest to one man's house or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?
<ASV> And they slew the Moabites at that time, about ten thousand men, all fat, and all men of valour, and not a man escaped.
<ASV> And Samson answered her: If I shall be bound with seven cords made of sinews not yet dry, but still moist, I shall be weak like other men.
<ASV> And he said, What did the Lord say to you? Do not keep it from me: may God's punishment be on you if you keep from me anything he said to you.
<ASV> David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.
<ASV> Then all the children of Israel took up arms, and the people came together like one man, from Dan to Beer-sheba, and the land of Gilead, before the Lord at Mizpah.
<ASV> And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
<ASV> So on the day of battle, there was not a sword or a spear found in the hands of all the army that was with Saul and Jonathan, but Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
<ASV> David put his hand in his bag, took a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.
<ASV> And Abimelech goeth unto Thebez, and encampeth against Thebez, and captureth it,
<ASV> Into your hands hath God delivered the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their spirit was appeased toward him, when he said that word.
<ASV> And Saul said to Michal, why have you been false to me, letting my hater go and get safely away? And in answer Michal said to Saul, He said to me, Let me go, or I will put you to death.
<ASV> He said to his servant, "Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah."
<ASV> And when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, they told him, saying: Behold, David is in the desert of Engaddi.
<ASV> And Jonathan made [a covenant] with the house of David, [saying,] Let Jehovah even require  at the hand of David's enemies!
<ASV> And the people said to Saul: Shall Jonathan then die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? This must not be. As the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people delivered Jonathan, that he should not die.
<ASV> And Gideon went up by the way used by the people living in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and made an attack on the army when they had no thought of danger.
<ASV> And the heads of Succoth say, `Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we give to thy host bread?'
<ASV> And they said, You have never been untrue to us or cruel to us; you have taken nothing from any man.
<ASV> And he said to Jether his firstborn, Arise, slay them! But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth.
<ASV> And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upwards.
<ASV> then he said, Lo, I come to do thy will. He takes away the first that he may establish the second;
<ASV> And the number of them that lapped, with their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men; and all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.
<ASV> And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring near to me every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slaughter them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slaughtered  there.
<ASV> By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encircled for seven days.
<ASV> and said thus: To life! and thou, peace; and thy house, peace; and all that thou hast -- peace!
<ASV> And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day; and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels, and fled.
<ASV> And now behold, the king walks before you; and I am old and grey-headed; and behold, my sons are with you; and I have walked before you from my youth up to this day.
<ASV> And Saul inquired of Yahweh, but Yahweh did not answer him, not by dreams or by the Urim or by the prophets.
<ASV> And it was so. He arose early the next day and squeezed the fleece, and he wrung out dew from the fleece, a full drinking bowl of water.
<ASV> `If ye fear Jehovah, and have served Him, and hearkened to His voice, then ye do not provoke the mouth of Jehovah, and ye have been -- both ye and the king who hath reigned over you -- after Jehovah your God.
<ASV> Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
<ASV> And Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, and they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
<ASV> So the two of them sat and ate and drank together, and the father of the young woman said to the man, "Please, agree to spend the night and enjoy yourself."
<ASV> And between the passages where Jonathan sought to pass over unto the station of the Philistines  the edge of a rock on the one side, and the edge of a rock on the other side, and the name of the one is Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
<ASV> to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel.
<ASV> And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:
<ASV> For we have not here a lasting city, but we seek one that is to come.
<ASV> Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence for the entrance into the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,
<ASV> And though a man has taken up arms against you, putting your life in danger, still the soul of my lord will be kept safe among the band of the living with the Lord your God; and the souls of those who are against you he will send violently away from him, like stones from a bag.
<ASV> The man said to Eli, "I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army." He said, "How did the matter go, my son?"
<ASV> Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
<ASV> And his base was at Ramah, where his house was; there he was judge of Israel and there he made an altar to the Lord.
<ASV> And David and his men went up, and pillaged Gessuri, and Gerzi, and the Amalecites: for these were of old the inhabitants of the countries, as men go to Sur, even to the land of Egypt.
<ASV> Then Yahweh came and stood there and called out as before, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel said, "Speak, because your servant is listening."
<ASV> And it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan; but with Saul and with Jonathan his son there was found.
<ASV> And having said these words, he let the mouth-bone go out of his hand; so that place was named Ramath-lehi.
<ASV> And Manoah took the young goat and the grain offering, and he offered it to Yahweh on the rock, to the one who performs miracles. And Manoah and his wife were watching.
<ASV> And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the Lord.
<ASV> And Samson said to them, If you go on like this, truly I will take my full payment from you; and that will be the end of it.
<ASV> Then he brought near the tribe of Benjamin according to its families, and the family of Matri was selected by lot. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen, and they sought him, but he could not be found.
<ASV> Who in the days of his flesh, having sent up prayers and requests with strong crying and weeping to him who was able to give him salvation from death, had his prayer answered because of his fear of God.
<ASV> For this reason the Lord God of Israel has said, Truly I did say that your family and your father's people would have their place before me for ever: but now the Lord says, Let it not be so; I will give honour to those by whom I am honoured, and those who have no respect for me will be of small value in my eyes.
<ASV> Then Yahweh called out to Samuel and he said, "Here I am!"
<ASV> And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall on the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and fell on the priests, and put to death that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod.
<ASV> His war-dress they put in the house of Astarte; and his body was fixed on the wall of Beth-shan.
<ASV> And when he had ended prophesying, he came to the high place.
<ASV> Nevertheless you have done well in communicating to my tribulation.
<ASV> And Saul commandeth his servants, `Speak unto David gently, saying, Lo, the king hath delighted in thee, and all his servants have loved thee, and now, be son-in-law to the king.'
<ASV> Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.
<ASV> But we are not among those who shrink back to destruction, but among those who have faith to the preservation of our souls.
<ASV> If one man sin against another, God will judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall intreat for him? But they hearkened not to the voice of their father, for Jehovah was minded to slay them.
<ASV> For earth, that is drinking in the rain many times coming upon it, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of whom also it is dressed, doth partake of blessing from God,
<ASV> And Samuel said to Saul, Jehovah sent *me* to anoint thee king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken to the voice of the words of Jehovah.
<ASV> And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
<ASV> Fighting the same fight which you saw in me, and now have word of in me.
<ASV> looking to the author and perfecter of faith -- Jesus, who, over-against the joy set before him -- did endure a cross, shame having despised, on the right hand also of the throne of God did sit down;
<ASV> And the men of the garrison spoke to Jonathan, and to his armourbearer, and said: Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armourbearer: Let us go up, follow me: for the Lord hath delivered them into the hands of Israel.
<ASV> And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, infants and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
<ASV> So Michal let David down through the window, and he went in flight and got away.
<ASV> And David said, "As Yahweh lives, certainly Yahweh will strike him, or his day will come and he will die, or he will go down in the battle and perish.
<ASV> And six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the cliff of Rimmon, and abode at the cliff of Rimmon four months.
<ASV> saying, "I will proclaim your name to my brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will sing in praise of you."
<ASV> Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you; and I will teach you the good and right way.
<ASV> And turn not aside after vain things which shall never profit you, nor deliver you, because they are vain.
<ASV> When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, "Come, and let us return, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys, and be anxious for us."
<ASV> And the words which David hath spoken are heard, and they declare before Saul, and he receiveth him;
<ASV> And it came to pass, when Samuel was offering the holocaust, the Philistines began the battle against Israel: but the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and terrified them, and they were overthrown before the face of Israel.
<ASV> And your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your young men -- the best, and your asses, he doth take, and hath prepared for his own work;
<ASV> And David is stronger than the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smiteth the Philistine, and putteth him to death, and there is no sword in the hand of David,
<ASV> since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief --
<ASV> For I have foretold unto him, that I will judge his house for ever, for iniquity, because he knew that his sons did wickedly, and did not chastise them.
<ASV> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,
<ASV> And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.
<ASV> And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.
<ASV> And Samuel saith, `And what  the noise of this flock in mine ears -- and the noise of the herd which I am hearing?'
<ASV> And he called hastily to his armourbearer, and said to him: Draw thy sword, and kill me: lest it should be said that I was slain by a woman. He did as he was commanded, and slew him.
<ASV> not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day of My taking  by their hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt -- because they did not remain in My covenant, and I did not regard them, saith the Lord, --
<ASV> Now while these things were in existence, the priests went into the first Tent at all times, for prayer and the making of offerings.
<ASV> though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.
<ASV> So now, take and make ready a new cart, and two cows which have never come under the yoke, and have the cows yoked to the cart, and take their young ones away from them:
<ASV> and they take captive the women who  in it; from small unto great they have not put any one to death, and they lead away, and go on their way.
<ASV> He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
<ASV> And Samson's wife weepeth for it, and saith, `Thou hast only hated me, and hast not loved me; the riddle thou hast put forth to the sons of my people -- and to me thou hast not declared it;' and he saith to her, `Lo, to my father and to my mother I have not declared  -- and to thee I declare !'
<ASV> Therefore not even the first covenant was ratified without blood.
<ASV> Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he stuck the spear into the wall. David fled, and escaped that night.
<ASV> And who will hearken to you in this matter? For as his share is that goes down to the battle, so shall his share be that abides by the baggage: they shall share alike.
<ASV> Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus,
<ASV> Then separating the three hundred men into three bands, he gave every man a horn, and a vessel in which was a flaming branch.
<ASV> And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
<ASV> Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fights Yahweh's battles. Evil will not be found in you all your days.
<ASV> Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of Yahweh's house. Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
<ASV> And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.
<ASV> Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle lines, one battle line against the other.
<ASV> For which cause there sprung even from one (and him as good as dead) as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
<ASV> And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.
<ASV> Then the Lord opened a great tooth in the jaw of the ass, and waters issued out of it. And when he had drank them he refreshed his spirit, and recovered his strength. Therefore the name of that place was called, The Spring of him that invoked from the jawbone, until this present day.
<ASV> And the children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.

<ASV> When they had gone some way from the house of Micah, the men from the houses near Micah's house came together and overtook the children of Dan,

<ASV> Who kept faith with God who gave him his place, even as Moses did in all his house.
<ASV> And David was achieving success in all his ways and Yahweh was with him,
<ASV> For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected Yahweh's word, he has also rejected you from being king."
<ASV> And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:
<ASV> The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side, but David's place was empty.

<ASV> For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things; by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer continually every year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect:

<ASV> Then Saul said to the Lord, the God of Israel, Why have you not given me an answer today? If the sin is in me or in Jonathan my son, O Lord God of Israel, give Urim, and if it is in your people Israel, give Thummim.

<ASV> and all this congregation shall know that Jehovah saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is Jehovah's, and he will give you into our hands.
<ASV> greater wealth having reckoned the reproach of the Christ than the treasures in Egypt, for he did look to the recompense of reward;
<ASV> So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.
<ASV> Saul said, "Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; and know and see in which this sin has been today.
<ASV> You have put all things in subjection under his feet." For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we don't see all things subjected to him, yet.
<ASV> And he brought him down, and behold, they were spread over the whole land, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
<ASV> Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil;

<ASV> each of you not looking out for your own interests, but also each of you for the interests of others.
<ASV> Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel; he was a great man and had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats: and he was cutting the wool of his sheep in Carmel.

<ASV> Then all the children of Israel rising up out of the places where they were, set their army in battle array, in the place which is called Baalthamar. The ambushes also which were about the city, began by little and little to come forth,
<ASV> And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.
<ASV> The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the livestock, and all that they found. Moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.

<ASV> And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
<ASV> for in that he suffered, himself being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
<ASV> And Jonathan said: Far be this from thee: for if I should certainly know that evil is determined by my father against thee, I could do no otherwise than tell thee.

<ASV> And Isai called Abinadab, and brought him before Samuel. And he said: Neither hath the Lord chosen this.
<ASV> And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations;
<ASV> The bows of mighty warriors are shattered, but those who stumble gird themselves with strength.
<ASV> And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.

<ASV> The Lord is the giver of death and life: sending men down to the underworld and lifting them up.
<ASV> On the seventh day, they said to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Isn't that so?"

<ASV> All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
<ASV> If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?
<ASV> And Juda said to Simeon his brother: Come up with me into my lot, and fight against the Chanaanite, that I also may go along with thee into thy lot. And Simeon went with him.

<ASV> and Caleb saith, `He who smiteth Kirjath-Sepher -- and hath captured it -- then I have given to him Achsah my daughter for a wife.'
<ASV> As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord; the same things to write to you to me indeed is not tiresome, and for you  sure;
<ASV> and it cometh to pass, at the revolution of the days, that Hannah conceiveth, and beareth a son, and calleth his name Samuel, `for, from Jehovah I have asked him.'
<ASV> Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. Therefore she told him nothing, until the morning light.
<ASV> And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.
<ASV> And I will make Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his war-carriages and his forces, come against you at the river Kishon, where I will give him into your hands.
<ASV> And Israel is very weak from the presence of Midian, and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah.
<ASV> So Jonathan spoke well about David to his father Saul and said to him, "The king should not sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his service for you has been very good.
<ASV> It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace.
<ASV> And turning from their road they came to the house of the young Levite, the house of Micah, and said to him, Is it well with you?

Set it before yourself and eat; because for the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, 'I have invited the people.'" So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
<ASV> And the watchmen of Saul, looking out from Geba in the land of Benjamin, saw all the army flowing away and running here and there.
<ASV> But David said to Abishai, "Do not destroy him! For who has stretched out his hand against Yahweh's anointed one and remained blameless?"
<ASV> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
<ASV> And at these words about the ark of God, Eli, falling back off his seat by the side of the doorway into the town, came down on the earth so that his neck was broken and death overtook him, for he was an old man and of great weight. He had been judging Israel for forty years.
<ASV> David therefore went from thence and fled to the cave of Odollam. And when his brethren, and all his father's house had heard of it, they went down to him thither;
<ASV> Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the Lord is with him.
<ASV> And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
<ASV> And the Philistines seize him, and pick out his eyes, and bring him down to Gaza, and bind him with two brazen fetters; and he is grinding in the prison-house.
<ASV> Now after David's talk with Saul was ended, the soul of Jonathan was joined with the soul of David, and David became as dear to him as his very life.
<ASV> and Nob, the city of the priests, he hath smitten by the mouth of the sword, from man even unto woman, from infant even unto suckling, and ox, and ass, and sheep, by the mouth of the sword.
<ASV> And it cometh to pass, at the time of the giving of Merab daughter of Saul to David, that she hath been given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.
<ASV> Then Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have brightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
<ASV> I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
<ASV> From now on I will not go on driving out from before them any of the nations which at the death of Joshua were still living in this land;
<ASV> Not as though I has already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow after, if I may by any means apprehend, wherein I am also apprehended by Christ Jesus.
<ASV> Now one day Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man who was with him, looking after his arms, Come, let us go over to the Philistine force over there. But he said nothing to his father.
<ASV> Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn't kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my life to take it.
<ASV> And he brought down the people to the water; and Jehovah said to Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down on his knees to drink.
<ASV> Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you hear his voice,
<ASV> In the same way Christ did not take for himself the glory of being made a high priest, but was given it by him who said, You are my Son, this day I have given you being:
<ASV> And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah. And Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they might not dwell in Shechem.
<ASV> Then Samuel summoned the people to Yahweh at Mizpah,
<ASV> He will take your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, even their best, and give them to his servants.
<ASV> At the sound of those dividing the sheep among the watering places, there they will recount the righteous deeds of Yahweh, the righteous deeds for his warriors in Israel. Then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates.
<ASV> Saul said to the troops that were with him, "Please call the roll and see who has gone from us." So they called the roll and found that Jonathan and his armor bearer were not present.
<ASV> Saul said to Samuel, "But I have obeyed Yahweh's voice, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
<ASV> For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind, and in their heart will I write them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:
<ASV> Then Saul said to the people who were with him, Let everyone be numbered and let us see who has gone from us. And when they had been numbered, it was seen that Jonathan and his servant were not there.
<ASV> And on the third day I will send arrows from my bow against its side as if at a mark.
<ASV> The servant again answered Saul and said, "Look, I have in my hand a quarter shekel of silver! I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us our way."
<ASV> And he said to all Israel: Be you on one side, and I with Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people answered Saul: Do what seemeth good in thy eyes.
<ASV> The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
<ASV> They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.
<ASV> So David went to a secret place in the country: and when the new moon came, the king took his place at the feast.
<ASV> The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away and scattered.
<ASV> Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the Lord; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.
<ASV> And it cometh to pass afterwards that he loveth a woman in the valley of Sorek, and her name  Delilah,
<ASV> And Saul speaketh unto Jonathan his son, and unto all his servants, to put David to death,
<ASV> by faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by a saying of God, in regard to the things seen not having come out of things appearing;
<ASV> "In a very little while, he who comes will come, and will not wait.
<ASV> But the servant said to him, See now, in this town there is a man of God, who is highly honoured, and everything he says comes true: let us go there now; it may be that he will give us directions about our journey.
<ASV> And some one of Israel said: Have you seen this man that is come up, for he is come up to defy Israel. And the man that shall slay him, the king will enrich with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and will make his father's house free from tribute in Israel.
<ASV> And they answer them and say, `He is; lo, before thee! haste, now, for to-day he hath come in to the city, for the people hath a stated sacrifice in a high place.
<ASV> And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there.
<ASV> Then said David, Jehovah, God of Israel, thy servant hath heard for certain that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
<ASV> The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened cakes and put them on this rock; pour the broth over it." And he did so.
<ASV> So David hid himself in the field. When the new moon had come, the king sat himself down to eat food.
<ASV> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
<ASV> Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
<ASV> And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: Jehovah will rule over you.
<ASV> And Adonibezec fled: and they pursued after him and took him, and cut off his fingers and toes.
<ASV> And Samson said to the boy who took him by the hand, Let me put my hand on the pillars supporting the house, so that I may put my back against them.
<ASV> For we who have believed enter into rest, just as he has said, "As I swore in my anger, 'They will never enter into my rest.'" And yet these works have been accomplished from the foundation of the world.
<ASV> And Saul said, God do so [to me] and more also; thou shalt certainly die, Jonathan.
<ASV> Saul said, "Tell David, 'The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies.'" Now Saul thought he would make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
<ASV> When I and all who are with me blow on the trumpet, you must also blow on the trumpets and surround the camp, and you must say, 'To Yahweh and to Gideon!'"
<ASV> And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.
<ASV> So he sent and made him come in. Now he had red hair and beautiful eyes and pleasing looks. And the Lord said, Come, put the oil on him, for this is he.
<ASV> And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, "Please stay, and let us prepare a young goat for you."
<ASV> And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
<ASV> But if they say, Come up to us; then we will go up, for the Lord has given them into our hands: and this will be the sign to us.
<ASV> And the Ziphites come in unto Saul, at Gibeah, saying, `Is not David hiding himself in the height of Hachilah, on the front of the desert?'
<ASV> But the children of Belial said, How should this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no gifts. But he was as one deaf.
<ASV> and the sons of worthlessness have said, `What! this one doth save us!' and they despise him, and have not brought to him a present; and he is as one deaf.
<ASV> And his armor bearer said, "Do all that is in your heart that you are inclined to do. I am with you all of the way!
<ASV> And they said, "Why, Yahweh, God of Israel, has it happened today in Israel that one tribe is lacking from Israel?"
<ASV> And Joshua sendeth the people away, and the sons of Israel go, each to his inheritance, to possess the land;
<ASV> Let our lord now speak; thy servants are before thee: they shall seek out a man, a skilful player on a harp; and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
<ASV> They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
<ASV> I will make him know that I am about to judge his household forever because of the iniquity that he knew, for his sons were bringing curses on themselves, but he did not rebuke them.
<ASV> And Saul said: I have sinned, return, my son David, for I will no more do thee harm, because my life hath been precious in thy eyes this day: for it appeareth that I have done foolishly, and have been ignorant in very many things.
<ASV> And that year the children of Israel were crushed under their yoke; for eighteen years all the children of Israel on the other side of Jordan, in the land of the Amorites which is in Gilead, were cruelly crushed down.
<ASV> This is the thing you will do: you will destroy every man and every woman who had sex with a man."
<ASV> Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
<ASV> And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli. And the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision.
<ASV> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he persevered, as seeing him who is invisible.
<ASV> Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.
<ASV> And this is what you shall observe: Every male, and all women that have known men, you shall kill, but the virgins you shall save.
<ASV> Moreover, that entire generation was gathered to their ancestors, and another generation grew up after them who did not know Yahweh or the work he had done for Israel.
<ASV> And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
<ASV> For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.
<ASV> When the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us get the ark of Yahweh's covenant out of Shiloh and bring it to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies."
<ASV> And Manoah rose up and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Art thou the man that didst speak to the woman? And he said, I am.
<ASV> Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: Between her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell, overcome.
<ASV> How much more will the blood of Christ, who, being without sin, made an offering of himself to God through the Holy Spirit, make your hearts clean from dead works to be servants of the living God?
<ASV> The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was very troubled, and said to him, "Behold, your servant has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.
<ASV> And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Come here to me with the ephod. And Abiathar took the ephod to David.
<ASV> And his servants declare to David these words, and the thing is right in the eyes of David, to be son-in-law to the king; and the days have not been full,
<ASV> Don't turn aside to go after vain things which can't profit or deliver, for they are vain.
<ASV> For the word of God is living and effectual, and more piercing than any two edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
<ASV> But Doeg the Edomite, who was stationed among the servants of Saul, answered and said, "I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
<ASV> Consequently a sabbath rest remains for the people of God.
<ASV> Then David said to the Philistine, "You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
<ASV> So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword. All these were men of valor.
<ASV> That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
<ASV> They that were full have hired themselves out for bread; and the hungry are  no more: Even the barren beareth seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
<ASV> Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
<ASV> Saul disguised himself and put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night. Then he said, "Please consult for me by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomever I shall name to you."
<ASV> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.
<ASV> Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,
<ASV> And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.
<ASV> His mother used to make for him a small robe and take it to him year by year whenever she came up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.
<ASV> And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.
<ASV> God having foreseen some better thing for us, that they should not be made perfect without us.
<ASV> And Saul saith, `I have sinned; turn back, my son David, for I do evil to thee no more, because that my soul hath been precious in thine eyes this day; lo, I have acted foolishly, and do err very greatly.'
<ASV> "Don't keep talking so exceedingly proudly. Don't let arrogance come out of your mouth, For Yahweh is a God of knowledge. By him actions are weighed.
<ASV> Then he said, "Why is my lord pursuing after his servant? For what have I done? And what evil is in my hand?
<ASV> And he said to her, What is his form? And she said, It is an old man coming up covered with a robe. And Saul saw that it was Samuel, and with his face bent down to the earth he gave him honour.
<ASV> But the children of Israel, adding new sins to their old ones, did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served idols, Baalim and Astaroth, and the gods of Syria and of Sidon and of Moab and of the children of Ammon and of the Philistines: and they left the Lord, and did not serve him.
<ASV> And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there has not been such a thing heretofore.
<ASV> And it came to pass when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
<ASV> And Samuel did what Jehovah said, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him, and said, Dost thou come peaceably?
<ASV> So the Philistines were subdued and they did not come into the territory of Israel again, and the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
<ASV> And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles thee.
<ASV> Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?
<ASV> And the Lord again appeared in Silo, for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Silo, according to the word of the Lord. And the word of Samuel came to pass to all Israel.
<ASV> And they came down from the high place into the city, and he spoke with Saul upon the roof.
<ASV> So when David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. The head of the Philistine was in his hand.
<ASV> Then build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold, in an orderly way, and take the second bull, and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down."
<ASV> For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;
<ASV> And Yahweh said, "Judah will go up. I hereby give the land into his hand."
<ASV> And Eli heard the noise of the crying, and said, What is the noise of this tumult? And the man came hastily, and told Eli.
<ASV> And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him; many fell slain up to the entrance of the gate.
<ASV> So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
<ASV> Then Saul said to his servants, "Seek for me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her." His servants said to him, "Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at Endor."
<ASV> and Israel and the Philistines set in array rank to meet rank.
<ASV> And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand; but we certainly shall not put thee to death. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the cliff.
<ASV> May grace be with you all.
<ASV> We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
<ASV> Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob. And vain men were gathered to Jephthah, and they made expeditions with him.
<ASV> The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.
<ASV> As to the man Micah, he hath a house of gods, and he maketh an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrateth the hand of one of his sons, and he is to him for a priest;
<ASV> So take care to get knowledge of all the secret places where he is taking cover, and be certain to come back to me, and I will go with you: and without doubt, if he is anywhere in the land, I will get him, among all the families of Judah.
<ASV> Jonathan said to David: O Lord God of Israel, if I shall discover my father's mind, to morrow or the day after, and there be any thing good for David, and I send not immediately to thee, and make it known to thee,
<ASV> And I took you out of the hands of the Egyptians and out of the hands of all who were cruel to you, and I sent them out by force from before you and gave you their land;
<ASV> And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah.
<ASV> Now his parents knew not that the thing was done by the Lord, and that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
<ASV> And the custom of the priests with the people was this: When any man brought a sacrifice, as the meat was boiling, the servant of the priest would take a three-pronged meat fork in his hand
<ASV> And Saul commanded all the people to go down to fight against Ceila, and to besiege David, and his men.
<ASV> And said to Saul: Why dost thou hear the words of men that say David seeketh thy hurt?
<ASV> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.
<ASV> And the servants of Saul speak in the ears of David these words, and David saith, `Is it a light thing in your eyes to be son-in-law to the king -- and I a poor man, and lightly esteemed?'
<ASV> For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he didn't restrain them.
<ASV> And he joined to him the children of Ammon, and Amalec: and he went and overthrew Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
<ASV> As Samuel turned around to go, he caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.
<ASV> Looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of God; for fear that some bitter root may come up to be a trouble to you, and that some of you may be made unclean by it;
<ASV> for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him.
<ASV> and also I have caused him to be asked for Jehovah, all the days that he hath lived -- he is asked for Jehovah;' and he boweth himself there before Jehovah.
<ASV> After that, the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland.
<ASV> Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying,
<ASV> and they took their daughters as wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
<ASV> At the time all punishment seems to be pain and not joy: but after, those who have been trained by it get from it the peace-giving fruit of righteousness.
<ASV> Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.
<ASV> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
<ASV> that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God, unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverse, among whom ye do appear as luminaries in the world,
<ASV> `For freeing freemen in Israel, For a people willingly offering themselves Bless ye Jehovah.
<ASV> And Michas said: Stay with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee every year ten pieces of silver, and a double suit of apparel, and thy victuals.
<ASV> And the sons of Israel say, `Who  he that hath not come up in the assembly out of all the tribes of Israel unto Jehovah?' for the great oath hath been concerning him who hath not come up unto Jehovah to Mizpeh, saying, `He is surely put to death.'
<ASV> And all that day Abimelech was fighting against the town; and he took it, and put to death the people who were in it, and had the town pulled down and covered with salt.
<ASV> And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, and we will make ready a kid of the goats for thee.
<ASV> then he said, `Lo, I come to do, O God, Thy will;' he doth take away the first that the second he may establish;
<ASV> for a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which was both the lamp-stand, and the table, and the bread of the presence -- which is called `Holy;'
<ASV> And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord's anointed is before him.
<ASV> Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, Who will go down with me to the tents of Saul? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.
<ASV> When I saw that you didn't save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me today, to fight against me?"
<ASV> And she saith unto her father, `Let this thing be done to me; desist from me two months, and I go on, and have gone down on the hills, and I weep for my virginity -- I and my friends.'
<ASV> And Samuel cometh in unto Saul, and Saul saith to him, `Blessed  thou of Jehovah; I have performed the word of Jehovah.'
<ASV> Be careful about nothing; but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;
<ASV> But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
<ASV> So Gedeon went in, and boiled a kid, and made unleavened loaves of a measure of flour: and putting the flesh in a basket, and the broth of the flesh into a pot, he carried all under the oak, and presented to him.
<ASV> And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to Jehovah. And they went to their own home.
<ASV> And said to her: How long wilt thou, be drunk? digest a little the wine, of which thou hast taken too much.
<ASV> The men of Kiriath Jearim came, and took Yahweh's ark, and brought it into Abinadab's house on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to keep Yahweh's ark.
<ASV> For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
<ASV> And he said to the lad that guided his steps: Suffer me to touch the pillars which support the whole house, and let me lean upon them, and rest a little.
<ASV> And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the Angel of God came again to the woman whilst she sat in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her.
<ASV> And David said to Achish, If now I have found favour in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some country-town, that I may abide there; for why should thy servant abide in the royal city with thee?
<ASV> And Gideon saith unto God, `Let not Thine anger burn against me, and I speak only this time; let me try, I pray Thee, only this time with the fleece -- let there be, I pray Thee, drought on the fleece alone, and on all the earth let there be dew.'
<ASV> And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of their spoilers.
<ASV> And the children of Israel arose and went up to Bethel, and inquired of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Judah first.
<ASV> And now, let not my blood fall to the earth far from the face of Jehovah; for the king of Israel is come out to seek a single flea, as when they hunt a partridge on the mountains.
<ASV> Give thought to him who has undergone so much of the hate of sinners against himself, so that you may not be tired and feeble of purpose.
<ASV> and, now, thy kingdom doth not stand, Jehovah hath sought for Himself a man according to His own heart, and Jehovah chargeth him for leader over His people, for thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.'
<ASV> Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice,
<ASV> And Michas filled his hand, and had the young man with him, for his priest, saying:
<ASV> And in the fields they saw an Egyptian whom they took to David, and they gave him bread, and he had a meal, and they gave him water for drink;
<ASV> Now therefore what is under your hand? Please give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever is available."
<ASV> And exposed his life to dangers, to deliver you from the hands of Madian,
<ASV> and had taken the women captives that were in it; both great and small: they had put none to death, but had carried them off, and went on their way.
<ASV> Then Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me!" But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.
<ASV> And she said: The glory is departed from Israel, because the ark of God was taken.
<ASV> And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
<ASV> Don't consider your servant a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation."

<ASV> For he did not make the angels rulers over the world to come, of which I am writing.
<ASV> And Samuel speaketh all the words of Jehovah unto the people who are asking from him a king,

<ASV> And being angry I made an oath, saying, They may not come into my rest.
<ASV> Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
<ASV> It is no longer my pleasure for Saul to be king; for he is turned back from going in my ways, and has not done my orders. And Samuel was very sad, crying to the Lord in prayer all night.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
<ASV> And Zebah and Zalmunna went in flight; and he went after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and put all the army to the curse.

<ASV> And when the children of Israel went out the next day to fight against the children of Benjamin,
<ASV> And crushing Benjamin down, they went after them, driving them from Nohah as far as the east side of Gibeah.

<ASV> And when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this young man? And Abner said, On your life, O king, I have no idea.
<ASV> And he went and caught three hundred foxes, and coupled them tail to tail, and fastened torches between the tails.
<ASV> Afterward, David's heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
<ASV> Yahweh looked at him, and said, "Go in this your might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Haven't I sent you?"
<ASV> And he came to Soccoth and said to them: Behold Zebee and Salmana, concerning whom you upbraided me, saying: Peradventure the hands of Zebee and Salmana, are in thy hands, and therefore thou demandest that we should give bread to the men that are weary and faint.

<ASV> A man of Benjamin ran out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with dirt on his head.

<ASV> Micah said to him, "Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food." So the Levite went in.
<ASV> And Abimelech the son of Jerobaal went to Sichem to his mother's brethren and spoke to them, and to all the kindred of his mother's father, saying:
<ASV> Deliver up the men of Gabaa, that have committed this heinous crime, that they may die, and the evil may be taken away out of Israel. But they would not hearken to the proposition of their brethren the children of Israel:
<ASV> And Gideon saith unto God, `If Thou art Saviour of Israel by my hand, as Thou hast spoken,
<ASV> And now, hearken to their voice; only, surely thou dost certainly protest to them, and hast declared to them the custom of the king who doth reign over them.'
<ASV> After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years.
<ASV> and the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn't draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.
<ASV> So get up early in the morning, with the servants of your lord who are with you, and go to the place I have given you, and have no evil design in your heart, for you are good in my eyes; but when there is light enough in the morning, go away.
<ASV> I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound. In everything and in all things I am initiated both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer privation.
<ASV> So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went with two of his men. And they came to the woman by night and he said, "Please consult a spirit for me through the ritual pit, and bring up for me the one whom I tell you."
<ASV> And the war is severe against the Philistines all the days of Saul; when Saul hath seen any mighty man, and any son of valour, then he doth gather him unto himself.
<ASV> And Abimelech with his band made a rush, and took up their position at the doorway into the town; and the other two bands made a rush on all those who were in the fields, and overcame them.
<ASV> And Saul is called, and all the people who  with him, and they come in unto the battle, and, lo, the sword of each hath been against his neighbour -- a very great destruction.
<ASV> And he said, "What is the message that he spoke to you? Please do not conceal it from me. May God punish you severely if you conceal anything from me of all the words that he told you."
<ASV> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence,
<ASV> Your chiefs, Issachar, were with Deborah; and Naphtali was true to Barak; into the valley they went rushing out at his feet. In Reuben there were divisions, and great searchings of heart.
<ASV> and to those in Rachal, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those in the cities of the Kenites,
<ASV> Any one that has disregarded Moses' law dies without mercy on [the testimony of] two or three witnesses:
<ASV> and the Philistines take the ark of God and bring it into the house of Dagon, and set it near Dagon.
<ASV> Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled: but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.
<ASV> When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, "Abner, whose son is this youth?" Abner said, "As your soul lives, O king, I can't tell."
<ASV> And he consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
<ASV> For they thought to cut them off, as they did before. But they artfully feigning a flight, designed to draw them away from the city, and by their seeming to flee to bring them to the highways aforesaid.
<ASV> When the Philistine looked around, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and had a good looking face.
<ASV> Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go."
<ASV> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
<ASV> if he be able to fight with me, and have smitten me, then we have been to you for servants; and if I am able for him, and have smitten him, then ye have been to us for servants, and have served us.'
<ASV> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.
<ASV> By faith they passed through the Red sea as through dry land; of which the Egyptians having made trial were swallowed up.
<ASV> By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers, receiving the spies with peace.
<ASV> Then Samuel sent for the people to come together before the Lord at Mizpah;
<ASV> Now I know God will do me good, since I have a priest of the race of the Levites.
<ASV> that by them I may test Israel, to see if they will keep the Yahweh's way to walk therein, as their fathers kept it, or not."
<ASV> And David said, What have I done now? was it not only a word?
<ASV> Let my lord give no attention to Nabal, that good-for-nothing: for as his name is, so is he, a man without sense: but I, your servant, did not see the young men whom my lord sent.
<ASV> And the men of Ephraim were called together, and passed over northwards, and said to Jephthah, Why didst thou pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? We will burn thy house upon thee with fire.
<ASV> And Ehud came to him; now he was sitting in the cool upper-chamber, which was for him alone. And Ehud said, I have a word from God unto thee. And he arose from the seat.
<ASV> Then Samuel taking Saul and his servant, brought them into the parlour, and gave them a place at the head of them that were invited. For there were about thirty men.
<ASV> All the limit of the Amorites was theirs, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok and from the waste land even to Jordan.
<ASV> But if ye will not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, and if ye rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then will the hand of Jehovah be against you, as against your fathers.
<ASV> And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
<ASV> And Samson goeth down to Timnath, and seeth a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines,
<ASV> Likewise, the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and Yahweh was with them.
<ASV> Then Saul and all the troops who were with him were assembled on command and came up to the battle, and look! Each Philistine's sword was against his friend; and there was a very great confusion.
<ASV> for we have not here an abiding city, but the coming one we seek;
<ASV> Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the Lord?
<ASV> That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
<ASV> And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.
<ASV> Pray for us: for we persuade ourselves that we have a good conscience, in all things desirous to walk rightly.
<ASV> Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
<ASV> "Most blessed of women is Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; most blessed is she of women among tent dwellers.
<ASV> Because of the voice of those who divide [the spoil] in the midst of the places of drawing water; There they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah, His righteous acts toward his villages in Israel. Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates.
<ASV> And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.
<ASV> And again, the Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and Yahweh gave them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
<ASV> The raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;
<ASV> And Jephthah vowed a vow to Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt without fail give the children of Ammon into my hand,
<ASV> But the people would not hear the voice of Samuel, and they said: Nay: but there shall be a king over us.
<ASV> And Achish answered and said to David, "I know that you are good in my eyes, like an angel of God! However, the commanders of the Philistines have said, 'He must not go up with us into the battle.'
<ASV> And departing from thence he went to the inhabitants of Dabir, the ancient name of which was Cariath-Sepher, that is, the city of letters.
<ASV> By so much is it a better agreement which we have through Jesus.
<ASV> And so then, please let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant: If Yahweh has incited you against me, may he delight in an offering; but if it is mortals, may they be accursed before Yahweh, for they have driven me away today from sharing in the inheritance of Yahweh, saying, 'Go, serve other gods!'
<ASV> And there riseth after Abimelech, to save Israel, Tola son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, and he is dwelling in Shamir, in the hill-country of Ephraim,

<ASV> And they laid the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the coffer with the golden mice and the images of their sores.
<ASV> And she answered him: My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth to the Lord, do unto me whatsoever thou hast promised, since the victory hath been granted to thee, and revenge of thy enemies.
<ASV> He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with a handsome face and good appearance. Yahweh said, "Arise! Anoint him, for this is he."
<ASV> And they find out of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four hundred young women, virgins, who have not known man by the lying of a male, and they bring them in unto the camp at Shiloh, which  in the land of Canaan.
<ASV> Jephte also said to them: If you be come to me sincerely, that I should fight for you against the children of Ammon, and the Lord shall deliver them into my band, shall I be your prince?
<ASV> And David came to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour-bearer.
<ASV> So let all thy enemies perish, O Lord: but let them that love thee shine, as the sun shineth in his rising.
<ASV> so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- !')
<ASV> And so, as your life was dear to me today, may my life be dear to the Lord, and may he make me free from all my troubles.
<ASV> And the Philistines are humbled, and have not added any more to come into the border of Israel, and the hand of Jehovah is on the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
<ASV> And it came to pass when the children of Israel cried to Jehovah because of Midian,
<ASV> And he said to him, Behold now, a man of God is in this city, and the man is held in honour; all that he says comes surely to pass. Let us now go thither: perhaps he will shew us the way that we should go.
<ASV> Then Gideon said to God, Do not be moved to wrath against me if I say only this: let me make one more test with the wool; let the wool now be dry, while the earth is covered with dew.
<ASV> but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that is about to consume the adversaries.
<ASV> And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was in great trouble, and said to him, See now, your servant has given ear to your words, and I have put my life in danger by doing what you said.
<ASV> When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh because of Midian,
<ASV> So Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them to a room in the building and gave them a place at the head of the invited guests. There were about thirty men.
<ASV> And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
<ASV> Then the Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the chest in which were the gold images, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh made burned offerings and gave worship that day before the Lord.
<ASV> But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
<ASV> When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Blessed is Yahweh, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil. Yahweh has returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head." David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to himself as wife.
<ASV> For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.
<ASV> Then her husband got up and went after her, with the purpose of talking kindly to her, and taking her back with him; he had with him his young man and two asses: and she took him into her father's house, and her father, when he saw him, came forward to him with joy.
<ASV> And there was trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the ravagers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked; for it was a trembling  God.
<ASV> By faith also Sarah herself did receive power to conceive seed, and she bare after the time of life, seeing she did judge Him faithful who did promise;
<ASV> Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah.

<ASV> And Adoni-Bezek said, Seventy kings, with their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gleaned under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.

<ASV> And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
<ASV> What ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you.
<ASV> And he himself also stripped off his clothes, and prophesied, himself also, before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?
<ASV> And Gedeon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents, on the east of Nobe and Jegbaa, and smote the camp of the enemies, who were secure, and suspected no hurt.
<ASV> because of this do ye also rejoice and joy with me.
<ASV> And Saul saw that he prospered well, and he stood in awe of him.
<ASV> And now what is under thy hand? give me five loaves in my hand, or what may be found.
<ASV> so that my imprisonment in Christ has become known in the whole praetorium and to all the rest,
<ASV> This shall not be an occasion of grief to thee, and a scruple of heart to my lord, that thou hast shed innocent blood, or hast revenged thyself: and when the Lord shall have done well by my lord, thou shalt remember thy handmaid.
<ASV> Then the evil spirit from Yahweh came upon Saul while he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing a stringed instrument in his hand.
<ASV> It was for those in Bethel, for those in Ramoth of the Negev, for those in Jattir,
<ASV> to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven enrolled, and to God the judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men made perfect,
<ASV> But I have received everything in full and have an abundance; I am well supplied because I received from Epaphroditus what you had sent, a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
<ASV> And he was very thirsty, and he called to Yahweh and said, "You gave this great victory into the hand of your servant, but now I must die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?"
<ASV> And the things which you have learned and received and heard about and seen in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.
<ASV> Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,
<ASV> This being told to Joatham, he went and stood on the top of mount Garizim: and lifting up his voice, he cried, and said: Hear me, ye men of Sichem, so may God hear you.
<ASV> and hath struck  into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the hook bringeth up doth the priest take for himself; thus they do to all Israel who are coming in, there, in Shiloh.
<ASV> If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,
<ASV> David said furthermore, As the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.
<ASV> Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
<ASV> They abandoned Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
<ASV> and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterwards shall thy hand be strengthened, and thou shalt go down unto the camp. And he went down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the camp.
<ASV> Now Saul was on the hill of Hakilah, which is opposite Jeshimon by the road, but David was staying in the wilderness. When he realized that Saul had come to the wilderness after him,
<ASV> The lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, "Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver."
<ASV> And Saul said to Achias: Bring the ark of the Lord. (For the ark of God was there that day with the children of Israel.)
<ASV> And the princes of the Philistines said to Achis: What mean these Hebrews? And Achis said to the princes of the Philistines: Do you not know David, who was the servant of Saul the king of Israel, and hath been with me many days, or years, and I have found no fault in him, since the day that he fled over to me until this day?
<ASV> And when he had come to his house, he got his knife, and took the woman, cutting her up bone by bone into twelve parts, which he sent through all Israel.
<ASV> And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, in which were the golden jewels, and put them on the great stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered up burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Jehovah.
<ASV> They said, "Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. Do you stand still? Don't be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.
<ASV> Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.
<ASV> Then Jonathan said to David, "Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you."
<ASV> And the blood was put on the Tent and all the holy vessels in the same way.
<ASV> But to which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?
<ASV> Who were left-handed, able to send a stone at a hair without error.
<ASV> But the man would not be kept there that night, and he got up and went away and came opposite to Jebus (which is Jerusalem); and he had with him the two asses, ready for travelling, and his woman.
<ASV> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
<ASV> And now hearken unto their voice; only, testify solemnly unto them, and declare unto them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
<ASV> and they crush and oppress the sons of Israel in that year -- eighteen years all the sons of Israel  are beyond the Jordan, in the land of the Amorite, which  in Gilead.
<ASV> My heart hath rejoiced in the Lord, and my horn is exalted in my God: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies: because I have joyed in thy salvation.
<ASV> not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they didn't continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them," says the Lord.
<ASV> And David said to Abner: Art not thou a man? and who is like thee in Israel? why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to kill the king thy lord.
<ASV> And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, and thou hast not injured us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man's hand.
<ASV> Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
<ASV> But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior for them, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.
<ASV> Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you."
<ASV> And she made a vow, saying: O Lord, of hosts, if thou wilt look down on the affliction of thy servant, and wilt be mindful of me, and not forget thy handmaid, and wilt give to thy servant a man child: I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.
<ASV> And Saul went back, and did not pursue after the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own places.
<ASV> Moreover David took also Achinoam of Jezrahel: and they were both of them his wives.
<ASV> And there is a certain man of Ramathaim-Zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name  Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, and Ephrathite,
<ASV> When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from the donkey and fell on her face before David's anger, and she bowed down to the ground.
<ASV> as to the thing which we have spoken, I and thou, lo, Jehovah  between me and thee -- unto the age.'
<ASV> Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men. All these drew the sword.
<ASV> And Saul sent messengers to arrest David, but she said, "He is ill."
<ASV> and [he will take them] that he may appoint for himself captains over thousands, and captains over fifties, and that they may plough his ground, and reap his harvest, and make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots.
<ASV> He said to them, "Why do you do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.
<ASV> And news was given to Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, Now God has given him into my hands; for by going into a walled town with locked doors, he has let himself be shut in.
<ASV> So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And when the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of the town made an outcry, saying, They have sent the ark of the God of Israel to us for the destruction of us and of our people.
<ASV> And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.
<ASV> By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
<ASV> And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner. And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
<ASV> And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
<ASV> since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once been purified?
<ASV> Be on the watch against dogs, against the workers of evil, against those of the circumcision:
<ASV> They said to the messengers who had come, "Thus you will say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: 'Tomorrow deliverance for you will come when the sun is hot.'" When the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced.
<ASV> And when Saul enquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
<ASV> and to those in Hormah, and to those in Chor-Ashan, and to those in Athach,
<ASV> Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-two years.
<ASV> And Manasseh did not dispossess Beth-shean and its dependent villages, nor Taanach and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependent villages; and the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
<ASV> And Saul abode at the extreme end of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which  in Migron; and the people that were with him were about six hundred men.
<ASV> The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,
<ASV> And they said to him, We are come to bind thee and to deliver thee into the hands of the Philistines. And Samson said to them: Swear to me, and promise me, that you will not kill me.
<ASV> Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up.
<ASV> God's ark was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
<ASV> And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me to seek me any more within all the limits of Israel, and I shall escape out of his hand.
<ASV> For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.
<ASV> By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
<ASV> Yahweh sent a prophet to the children of Israel; and he said to them, "Yahweh says, the God of Israel, 'I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you out of the house of bondage.
<ASV> But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David. And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill thee; and now, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place and hide thyself;
<ASV> Into your hand hath God given the heads of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what have I been able to do like you?' Then their temper desisted from off him in his speaking this thing.
<ASV> Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and the flesh of my cattle, which I have killed for my shearers, and give to men whom I know not whence they are?
<ASV> It came to pass that as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.
<ASV> And it cometh to pass, while Saul spake unto the priest, that the noise which  in the camp of the Philistines goeth on, going on and becoming great, and Saul saith unto the priest, `Remove thy hand.'
<ASV> So all the trees said to the thornbush, 'You, come rule over us.'
<ASV> Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him. He said, "It is Yahweh. Let him do what seems good to him."
<ASV> Now David had said, What was the use of my taking care of this man's goods in the waste land, so that there was no loss of anything which was his? he has only given me back evil for good.
<ASV> And the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and serve the Baalim,
<ASV> However I will not altogether take away a man of thee from my altar: but that thy eyes may faint and thy soul be spent: and a great part of thy house shall die when they come to man's estate.
<ASV> And they gave him part of a cake of figs and some dry grapes; and after the food, his spirit came back to him, for he had had no food or drink for three days and nights.
<ASV> And Jephthah sent again to the king of the children of Ammon,
<ASV> And David said to Abigail: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me, and blessed be thy speech:
<ASV> By that pleasure we have been made holy, by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for ever.
<ASV> And the servants of Achis, when they saw David, said to him: Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to him in their dances, saying: Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
<ASV> And David also rose up after him: and going out of the cave cried after Saul, saying: My lord the king. And Saul looked behind him: and David bowing himself down to the ground, worshipped,
<ASV> Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.
<ASV> And Yahweh said to him, "Peace be with you. Do not fear; you will not die."
<ASV> The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, "Why did you cross over and make war against the Ammonites, and why did you not call us to go with you? We will burn down your house over you with fire."
<ASV> If thy father should actually miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city; for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
<ASV> And one answered another, saying: And who is their father? therefore it became a proverb: Is Saul also among the prophets?
<ASV> And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in fighting order against Gibeah as before.
<ASV> As it is said, Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart, as when you made him angry.
<ASV> Then they found an Egyptian man in the open country and brought him to David, and they gave him food and he ate; they also gave him water.
<ASV> They cut off his head, stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to the house of their idols, and to the people.
<ASV> And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and not one of his words fell to the ground.
<ASV> and not in order that he can offer himself many times, as the high priest enters into the sanctuary year by year with blood not his own,
<ASV> And your seed and your vineyards he doth tithe, and hath given to his eunuchs, and to his servants.
<ASV> For ye both sympathised with prisoners and accepted with joy the plunder of your goods, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better substance, and an abiding one.
<ASV> After which David's heart struck him, because he had cut off the hem of Saul's robe.
<ASV> for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and Yahweh worked a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?"
<ASV> Saul said to the Kenites, "Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
<ASV> Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail. This woman was intelligent and had a beautiful face; but the man was surly and evil in his doings. He was of the house of Caleb.
<ASV> Saul sent to Jesse, saying, "Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight."
<ASV> When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, 'For Yahweh and for Gideon!'"
<ASV> And the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Masphath, and the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard this, they were afraid of the Philistines.
<ASV> And Samuel said to him: What hast thou done? Saul answered: Because I saw that the people slipt from me, and thou wast not come according to the days appointed, and the Philistines were gathered together in Machmas,
<ASV> And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
<ASV> We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,
<ASV> And there is a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name  Micah,
<ASV> And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins who had not had sex with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
<ASV> And again the Lord said, Samuel. And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, Here am I; for you certainly said my name. But he said in answer, I said nothing, my son; go to your rest again.
<ASV> And Samuel said, Bring ye near to me Agag the king of Amalek. And Agag came to him gaily. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
<ASV> There was a certain Levite, who dwelt on the side of mount Ephraim, who took a wife of Bethlehem Juda:
<ASV> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: and he delivered them into the hands of the Philistines forty years.
<ASV> The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh's sight; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
<ASV> And he riseth early in the morning, on the fifth day, to go, and the father of the young woman saith, `Support, I pray thee, thy heart;' and they have tarried till the turning of the day, and they eat, both of them.
<ASV> For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
<ASV> and go out into the field, and gather their vineyards, and tread, and make praises, and go into the house of their god, and eat and drink, and revile Abimelech.
<ASV> The children of Israel said to Yahweh, "We have sinned! Do you to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us, please, today."
<ASV> Now therefore if thou have any thing at hand, though it were but five loaves, give me, or whatsoever thou canst find.
<ASV> And you are now risen up against my father's house, and have killed his sons seventy men upon one stone, and have made Abimelech the son of his handmaid king over the inhabitants of Sichem, because he is your brother:
<ASV> Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will shew ourselves to them.
<ASV> And Saul saith unto Samuel, `I have sinned, for I passed over the command of Jehovah, and thy words; because I have feared the people, I also hearken to their voice;
<ASV> but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers;
<ASV> Fear not: for the hand of my father Saul shall not find thee, and thou shalt reign over Israel, and I shall be next to thee, yea, and my father knoweth this.
<ASV> And they make a covenant both of them before Jehovah; and David abideth in the forest, and Jonathan hath gone to his house.
<ASV> For such a chief priest did become us -- kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,
<ASV> If you will fear the Lord, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and not provoke the mouth of the Lord: then shall both you, and the king who reigneth over you, be followers of the Lord your God.
<ASV> And the servant-wife he had in Shechem had a son by him, to whom he gave the name Abimelech.
<ASV> The men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, saying, "None of us will give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife."
<ASV> Wherefore Jehovah the God of Israel saith, I said indeed, Thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever. But now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
<ASV> That same night, Yahweh said to him, "Take your father's bull, even the second bull seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is by it.
<ASV> And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the Lord your God was your king.
<ASV> So that we may confidently say: The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man shall do to me.
<ASV> while it is said, "Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion."
<ASV> And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
<ASV> And they left the Lord the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt: and they followed strange gods, and the gods of the people that dwelt round about them, and they adored them: and they provoked the Lord to anger.
<ASV> For God is my witness how I long after you all in  bowels of Christ Jesus.
<ASV> For in that, wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted, he is able to succour them also that are tempted.
<ASV> not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a custom of certain , but exhorting, and so much the more as ye see the day coming nigh.
<ASV> And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the Lord liveth, he shall not be slain.
<ASV> And Jonathan answereth Saul, `David hath been earnestly asked of me unto Beth-Lehem,
<ASV> Then he said, See, I have come to do your pleasure. He took away the old order, so that he might put the new order in its place.
<ASV> And he inquired of Yahweh for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
<ASV> And Ehud escaped while they delayed. He passed by the sculptured stones and escaped to Seirah.
<ASV> Then Zebul said to him, Now where is your loud talk when you said, Who is Abimelech that we are to be his servants? Is this not the people whom you were rating so low? Go out now, and make war on them.
<ASV> And the Philistines have taken the ark of God, and bring it in from Eben-Ezer to Ashdod,
<ASV> And Saul, desiring directions from God, said, Am I to go down after the Philistines? will you give them up into the hands of Israel? But he gave him no answer that day.
<ASV> If the man said to him, "Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires"; then he would say, "No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force."

<ASV> Gideon said to God, "Don't let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Please let me make a trial just this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew."
<ASV> and others of mockings and scourgings did receive trial, and yet of bonds and imprisonment;
<ASV> and on the third day thou dost certainly come down, and hast come in unto the place where thou wast hidden in the day of the work, and hast remained near the stone Ezel.

<ASV> Looking diligently, lest any man be wanting to the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up do hinder, and by it many be defiled.

<ASV> Since therefore it remains for some to enter into it, and the ones to whom the good news was proclaimed previously did not enter because of disobedience,
<ASV> Then Delilah said to Samson, Up to now you have made sport of me with false words; now say truly, how may you be put in bands? And he said to her, If you get the seven twists of my hair worked into the cloth you are making and fixed with the pin, I will become feeble and will be like any other man.

<ASV> If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
<ASV> And David took these words to heart, fearing Achish, the king of Gath.
<ASV> So Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he eluded Saul, so that he struck the spear into the wall, and David fled and escaped that same night.

<ASV> The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
<ASV> And David swore again and again, and said, Thy father certainly knows that I have found favour in thy sight: and he has thought, Jonathan shall not know this, lest he be grieved; but truly  Jehovah liveth, and  thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.
<ASV> The angel of the Lord put forth the tip of the rod, which he held in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened loaves: and there arose a fire from the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened loaves: and the angel of the Lord vanished out of his sight.
<ASV> And Saul saith unto Samuel, `Because -- I have hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, and I go in the way which Jehovah hath sent me, and bring in Agag king of Amalek, and Amalek I have devoted;
<ASV> Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two bottles of wine, five sheep ready dressed, five seahs of parched grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.
<ASV> And the sons of Israel draw near unto the sons of Benjamin on the second day,
<ASV> And they go up in to the city; they are coming in to the midst of the city, and lo, Samuel is coming out to meet them, to go up to the high place;
<ASV> And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
<ASV> As she continued praying before Yahweh, Eli saw her mouth.
<ASV> By faith Joseph, as he was dying, mentioned about the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions about his bones.

<ASV> And it came to pass in that night, that Jehovah said to him, Arise, go down to the camp; for I have given it into thy hand.

<ASV> Wandering in waste places and in mountains and in holes in the rocks; for whom the world was not good enough.
<ASV> That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.
<ASV> And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I pursue after these robbers, and shall I overtake them, or not? And the Lord said to him: Pursue after them: for thou shalt surely overtake them and recover the prey.

<ASV> And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:
<ASV> And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the Lord, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
<ASV> (And Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, Jehovah's priest in Shiloh, wore the ephod.) And the people did not know that Jonathan was gone.

<ASV> And when the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
<ASV> And Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the Lord in Shiloh, who had the ephod. And the people had no idea that Jonathan had gone.
<ASV> For finding fault, he says to them, Behold, days come, saith the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant as regards the house of Israel, and as regards the house of Juda;
<ASV> but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,
<ASV> But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
<ASV> Then all the children of Israel went out and gathered together as one man from Dan to Bersabee, with the land of Galaad, to the Lord in Maspha:
<ASV> And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?
<ASV> While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?

<ASV> And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David.
<ASV> Let your modesty be known to all men. The Lord is nigh.

<ASV> And call to your remembrance the former days, in which, having been enlightened, ye did endure much conflict of sufferings,
<ASV> By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she welcomed the spies in peace.
<ASV> But the triumpher in Israel will riot spare, and will not be moved to repentance: for he is not a mail that he should repent.
<ASV> And Saul said to his servant, But if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and we have no present to give to the man of God: what have we?
<ASV> The trees set out to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us.'
<ASV> to those who were in Aroer, to those who were in Siphmoth, to those who were in Eshtemoa,
<ASV> And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words; for I feared the people, and hearkened to their voice.
<ASV> So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.
<ASV> —And they came to their brethren at Zoreah and Eshtaol. And their brethren said to them, What  ye?
<ASV> Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle; and behold, they were all striking each other with their swords in very great confusion.
<ASV> Is it not now the time of the grain cutting? My cry will go up to the Lord and he will send thunder and rain: so that you may see and be conscious of your great sin which you have done in the eyes of the Lord in desiring a king for yourselves.
<ASV> Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
<ASV> for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those sanctified;
<ASV> And Gedeon seeing that it was the angel of the Lord, said: Alas, my Lord God: for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face.
<ASV> that they say to him, `Say, I pray thee, Shibboleth;' and he saith, `Sibboleth,' and is not prepared to speak right -- and they seize him, and slaughter him at the passages of the Jordan, and there fall at that time, of Ephraim, forty and two chiefs.
<ASV> So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
<ASV> If a man sins against a man, then God can intercede for him. But if a man sins against Yahweh, who can intercede for him?" But they did not obey their father, because Yahweh wanted to kill them.
<ASV> Then Saul said to David, "Blessed are you, my son David; you will not only do many things, but also will always succeed!" Then David went on his way and Saul returned to his place.
<ASV> Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the same, that through death he might destroy him having the power of death -- that is, the devil --
<ASV> And to them that were in Aroer and that were in Sephamoth, and that were in Esthamo,
<ASV> Then he said to David, "You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me the good, but I have repaid you the evil.
<ASV> Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
<ASV> And David leaving the vessels which he had brought, under the care of the keeper of the baggage, ran to the place of the battle and asked if all things went well with his brethren.

<ASV> When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, "Behold, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains." Zebul said to him, "You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men."

<ASV> David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, "What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
<ASV> by faith Moses, having become great, did refuse to be called a son of the daughter of Pharaoh,
<ASV> but if to live in flesh [is my lot], this is for me worth the while: and what I shall choose I cannot tell.
<ASV> And David said to Saul, Who am I? and what is my life,  my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?
<ASV> But if I say this to the boy, 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you;' then go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.
<ASV> Give words of love from me to those who are rulers over you, and to all the saints. Those who are in Italy send you their love.

<ASV> When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.
<ASV> Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, think this way. If in anything you think otherwise, God will also reveal that to you.
<ASV> For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified  all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
<ASV> and could set free these who through fear of death were subject to slavery throughout all their lives.

<ASV> For rebellion is like the sin of divination; arrogance is like iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has rejected you from being king!"
<ASV> And when Samuel was come to Saul, Saul said to him: Blessed be thou of the Lord, I have fulfilled the word of the Lord.
<ASV> He said, "You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away! What more do I have? How can you ask me, 'What ails you?'"

<ASV> Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him: "Thus says Yahweh: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to the house of your ancestor when they were in Egypt under the house of Pharaoh?
<ASV> When you have gone away from me today, you will see two men by the resting-place of Rachel's body, in the land of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, The asses which you went in search of have come back, and now your father, caring no longer for the asses, is troubled about you, saying, What am I to do about my son?
<ASV> And David saith unto Abishai, `Destroy him not; for who hath put forth his hand against the anointed of Jehovah, and been acquitted?'
<ASV> And Saul sendeth messengers unto the house of David to watch him, and to put him to death in the morning; and Michal his wife declareth to David, saying, `If thou art not delivering thy life to-night -- tomorrow thou art put to death.'
<ASV> We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
<ASV> The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, "No, my brothers, please don't act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, don't do this folly.
<ASV> They instructed the descendants of Benjamin, saying, "Go, lie in ambush in the vineyards,
<ASV> Samuel said, "Just as your sword bereaved women, so will your mother be bereaved among women!" Then Samuel hacked Agag to pieces in the presence of Yahweh at Gilgal.
<ASV> and Jonathan saith to David, `Go in peace, in that we have sworn -- we two -- in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah is between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed -- unto the age;' and he riseth and goeth; and Jonathan hath gone in to the city.
<ASV> Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh.
<ASV> And after him Elon the Zebulunite judgeth Israel, and he judgeth Israel ten years,
<ASV> But Jonathan, having no knowledge of the oath his father had put on the people, stretching out the rod which was in his hand, put the end of it in the honey, and put it to his mouth; then his eyes were made bright.
<ASV> Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession.
<ASV> And Saul inquired of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel? But he did not answer him that day.
<ASV> And he waiteth seven days, according to the appointment with Samuel, and Samuel hath not come to Gilgal, and the people are scattered from off him.
<ASV> and he saith to them, `Why do ye things like these? for I am hearing of your evil words from all the people -- these!
<ASV> Then three thousand of the men of Judah went down to the crack of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Is it not clear to you that the Philistines are our rulers? What is this you have done to us? And he said to them, I only did to them as they did to me.
<ASV> but into the second, the high priest only, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people:
<ASV> and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold in the proper arrangement, and take a second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you will cut down.
<ASV> He took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag which he had. His sling was in his hand; and he came near to the Philistine.
<ASV> And he said to them, This is what Micah did for me, and he gave me payment and I became his priest.
<ASV> And the two of them made an agreement before the Lord: and David went on living in Horesh, and Jonathan went back to his house.
<ASV> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
<ASV> And he saith unto Him, `If, I pray Thee, I have found grace in Thine eyes, then Thou hast done for me a sign that Thou art speaking with me.
<ASV> And Jonathan maketh -- also David -- a covenant, because he loveth him as his own soul,
<ASV> and it cometh to pass when they see him, that they take thirty companions, and they are with him.
<ASV> And David said to Abiathar: I knew that day when Doeg the Edomite was there, that without doubt he would tell Saul: I have been the occasion of the death of all the souls of thy father's house.
<ASV> You made him for a short time lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor;
<ASV> And though he was a Son, through the pain which he underwent, the knowledge came to him of what it was to be under God's orders;
<ASV> But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.
<ASV> And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.
<ASV> And Manoah saith, `Now let thy words come to pass; what is the custom of the youth -- and his work?'
<ASV> From that day Gedeon was called Jerobaal, because Joss had said: Let Baal revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar.
<ASV> and Samuel saith, `What hast thou done?' And Saul saith, `Because I saw that the people were scattered from off me, and thou hadst not come at the appointment of the days, and the Philistines are gathered to Michmash,
<ASV> Then whoever comes out from the door of my house, meeting me when I come back in peace from the children of Ammon, will be the Lord's and I will give him as a burned offering.
<ASV> And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,
<ASV> And when he had ended these words singing, he threw the jawbone out of his hand, and called the name of that place Ramathlechi, which is interpreted the lifting up of the jawbone.
<ASV> Of whom we have much to say, and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.
<ASV> Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me." Yahweh said, "Take a heifer with you, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.
<ASV> So the king said to the runners who were stationed around him, "Turn and kill the priests of Yahweh, because they also support David and because they knew that he was fleeing and did not disclose it to me." But the servants of the king were not willing to raise their hand to attack the priests of Yahweh.
<ASV> And Saul and his men went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men went on the other: and David's purpose was to get away as quickly as possible, for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men were making a circle round David and his men in order to take them.
<ASV> And he said to her, Get up and let us be going; but there was no answer; so he took her up and put her on the ass, and went on his way and came to his house.
<ASV> And the messengers came in, and behold, the image was in the bed, and the net of goats'  at its head.
<ASV> For we know him that hath said: Vengeance belongeth to me, and I will repay. And again: The Lord shall judge his people.
<ASV> Do not be turned away by different strange teachings, because it is good for your hearts to be made strong by grace, and not by meats, which were of no profit to those who took so much trouble over them.
<ASV> And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,
<ASV> And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the Lord said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord.
<ASV> And the man Elkanah with all his family went up to make the year's offering to the Lord, and to give effect to his oath.
<ASV> And the men of Israel said, "Did you see this man who has come up? For he is going up to defy Israel! It will be that the man who defeats him, the king will make him very rich with great wealth and will give him his daughter in marriage and will make his father's house free in Israel."
<ASV> So Jonathan the son of Saul got up and went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him through God.
<ASV> And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.
<ASV> and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe? --
<ASV> The Lord killeth and maketh alive, he bringeth down to hell and bringeth back again.
<ASV> Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.
<ASV> He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
<ASV> God also bearing them witness by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.
<ASV> Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;
<ASV> For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
<ASV> Because of this, it is all the more necessary that we pay attention to the things we have heard, lest we drift away.
<ASV> And he goeth thither -- unto Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit of God is upon him -- him also; and he goeth, going on, and he prophesyeth till his coming in to Naioth in Ramah,
<ASV> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.
<ASV> And he numbered them in Bezek, and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
<ASV> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure of the Egyptians. For he looked unto the reward.
<ASV> So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
<ASV> And the citizens of Shechem set liers in wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them. And it was told Abimelech.
<ASV> By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
<ASV> And David abode with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household; David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jizreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
<ASV> Not that I did already obtain, or have been already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by the Christ Jesus;
<ASV> And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.
<ASV> And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.
<ASV> (Because the law made nothing complete), and in its place there is a better hope, through which we come near to God.
<ASV> Then they said to him, Say now Shibboleth! and he said, Sibboleth, and did not manage to pronounce  rightly. Then they took him, and slaughtered him at the fords of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim forty-two thousand.
<ASV> And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord.
<ASV> Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
<ASV> And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;
<ASV> And David came to Nobe to Achimelech the priest: and Achimelech was astonished at David's coming. And he said to him: Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?
<ASV> So that their shares, and their spades, and their forks, and their axes were blunt, even to the goad, which was to be mended.
<ASV> Do not neglect hospitality, because through this some have received angels as guests without knowing it.
<ASV> Now while she was a long time in prayer before the Lord, Eli was watching her mouth.
<ASV> And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
<ASV> But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.
<ASV> And he who is bearing tidings answereth and saith, `Israel hath fled before the Philistines, and also a great slaughter hath been among the people, and also thy two sons have died -- Hophni and Phinehas -- and the ark of God hath been captured.'
<ASV> And David having girded his sword upon his armour, began to try if he could walk in armour: for he was not accustomed to it. And David said to Saul: I cannot go thus, for I am not used to it. And he laid them off,
<ASV> as to zeal, persecuting the assembly; as to righteousness which  in  law, found blameless;
<ASV> And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
<ASV> For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
<ASV> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
<ASV> And the king saith, `Thou dost surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all the house of thy father.'
<ASV> because you will conceive and bear a son. No razor will touch his head, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth. And it is he who will begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines."
<ASV> And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
<ASV> So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel, and he and his men went to search for David in the direction of the Rocks of the Mountain Goats.
<ASV> So Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh. Then the angel did an amazing thing as Manoah and his wife watched.
<ASV> Now therefore hear thou also the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set before thee a morsel of bread, that thou mayest eat and recover strength, and be able to go on thy journey.
<ASV> Then Manoah prayed to Jehovah, and said, Ah Lord! let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, I pray thee, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.
<ASV> And the angel of the Lord said to him: Take the flesh and the unleavened loaves, and lay them upon that rock, and pour out the broth thereon. And when he had done so,
<ASV> Then Eli answered, "Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him."
<ASV> And Saul said, Truly, I have done the orders of the Lord and have gone the way the Lord sent me; I have taken Agag, the king of Amalek, and have given the Amalekites up to destruction.
<ASV> And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
<ASV> And when they had turned a little aside, they went into the house of the young man the Levite, who was in the house of Michas: and they saluted him with words of peace.
<ASV> And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and they entered there and took the carved divine image, ephod, teraphim, and the molten image. The priest was standing at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with the weapons of war.
<ASV> And Jotham hasteth, and fleeth, and goeth to Beer, and dwelleth there, from the face of Abimelech his brother.
<ASV> Now Deborah, a woman prophet, the wife of Lapidoth, was judge of Israel at that time.
<ASV> And David took the head of the Philistine to Jerusalem, but the metal war-dress and the arms he put in his tent.
<ASV> So that we, who have gone in flight from danger to the hope which has been put before us, may have a strong comfort in two unchanging things, in which it is not possible for God to be false;
<ASV> And the sons of Dan raise up for themselves the graven image, and Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Manasseh, he and his sons have been priests to the tribe of the Danite, till the day of the removal of [the people] of the land.
<ASV> Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the cliff Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us? And what is this that thou hast done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.
<ASV> But whenever the judge was dead, they went back and did more evil than their fathers, going after other gods, to be their servants and their worshippers; giving up nothing of their sins and their hard-hearted ways.
<ASV> Then calling to him all the men of Galaad, he fought against Ephraim: and the men of Galaad defeated Ephraim, because he had said: Galaad is a fugitive of Ephraim, and dwelleth in the midst of Ephraim and Manasses.
<ASV> And his brethren and all his kindred, going down took his body, and buried it between Saraa and Esthaol in the buryingplace of his father Manue: and he judged Israel twenty years.
<ASV> And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
<ASV> My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
<ASV> And the angel of the Lord appeared to them no more. And forthwith Manue understood that it was an angel of the Lord,
<ASV> And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
<ASV> But whatever things were gain to me, these things I have considered loss because of Christ.
<ASV> Then I grabbed my concubine and cut her into pieces, and I sent her throughout all the territory of Israel's inheritance; for they committed a shameful and disgraceful thing in Israel.
<ASV> And the house was full of men and women, and all of the rulers of the Philistines were there—about three thousand men and women were on the roof watching the performance of Samson.
<ASV> And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:
<ASV> And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
<ASV> If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
<ASV> His oldest brother Eliab heard while he was speaking to the men, and Eliab became very angry against David and said, "Why have you come down today, and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumptuousness and the evil of your heart! For you have come down in order to see the battle!"
<ASV> Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
<ASV> Aod went in to him: now he was sitting in a summer parlour alone, and he said: I have a word from God to thee. And he forthwith rose up from his throne,
<ASV> By faith we understand the worlds were created by the word of God, in order that what is seen did not come into existence from what is visible.
<ASV> Saul then summoned all of the army for the battle, to go down to Keilah to lay a siege against David and his men.
<ASV> And these ten portions of cheese you will bring to the commander of the thousand; find out how your brothers are doing, and take their pledge."
<ASV> Now Samson went to Gaza, and there he saw a loose woman and went in to her.
<ASV> having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, covered round in every part with gold, in which  the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant;
<ASV> and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was,
<ASV> partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so living,
<ASV> And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
<ASV> Be not carried away with various and strange doctrines; for [it is] good that the heart be confirmed with grace, not meats; those who have walked in which have not been profited by .
<ASV> But she made him sleep upon her knees, and lay his head in her bosom. And she called a barber, and shaved his seven locks, and began to drive him away, and thrust him from her: for immediately his strength departed from him.
<ASV> And the Philistine goeth on, going and drawing near unto David, and the man bearing the buckler  before him,
<ASV> And God doth so on that night, and there is drought on the fleece alone, and on all the earth there hath been dew.
<ASV> Then he went down and talked to the woman, and she pleased Samson.
<ASV> And they went up and put up their tents in Kiriath-jearim in Judah: so that place is named Mahaneh-dan to this day. It is to the west of Kiriath-jearim.
<ASV> And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
<ASV> So David went, and his six hundred men went with him, and they came to the stream Besor.
<ASV> and who doth hearken to you in this thing? for as the portion of him who was brought down into battle, so also  the portion of him who is abiding by the vessels -- alike they share.'
<ASV> Let brotherly love remain;
<ASV> And Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, and said, Hitherto Jehovah has helped us.
<ASV> And Moses certainly kept faith as a servant, in all his house, and as a witness of those things which were to be said later;
<ASV> And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.
<ASV> When the people of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before Yahweh's ark. They took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
<ASV> So the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the ark of the Lord to the house of Abinadab in Gibeah, and they made his son Eleazar holy and put the ark in his care.
<ASV> And all these people who are here today may see that the Lord does not give salvation by sword and spear: for the fight is the Lord's, and he will give you up into our hands.
<ASV> Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
<ASV> So that, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,
<ASV> And Saul hearkeneth to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul sweareth, `Jehovah liveth -- he doth not die.'
<ASV> and if thou art afraid to go down -- go down, thou and Phurah thy young man, unto the camp,
<ASV> And all the people said to Samuel, Make prayer for us to the Lord your God so that death may not overtake us: for in addition to all our sins we have done this evil, in desiring a king.
<ASV> Jesus Christ yesterday and to-day the same, and to the ages;
<ASV> And all that generation was gathered to their fathers: and there arose others that knew not the Lord, and the works which he had done for Israel.
<ASV> So all the people got branches, every man cutting down a branch, and they went with Abimelech at their head and, massing the branches against the inner room, put fire to the room over them; so all those who were in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women, were burned to death with it.
<ASV> And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.
<ASV> Saul commanded his servants, "Talk with David secretly, and say, 'Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore be the king's son-in-law.'"
<ASV> And if their fathers or their brothers complain to us, we will say to them, 'Allow us to have them, because we did not capture a wife for each man in the battle, and because you did not give them to them, or else you would have been guilty.'"
<ASV> And David said to Achish, You will see now what your servant will do. And Achish said to David, Then I will make you keeper of my head for ever.
<ASV> And he came to his father's house, to Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy persons upon one stone; but there remained Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal; for he had hid himself.
<ASV> Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
<ASV> And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
<ASV> Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines."
<ASV> But to Hannah he gave one part, though Hannah was very dear to him, but the Lord had not let her have children.
<ASV> and the ambush have hasted, and push against Gibeah, and the ambush draweth itself out, and smiteth the whole of the city by the mouth of the sword.
<ASV> only that the generations of the children of Israel might know war by learning it, at the least those who before had known nothing thereof:
<ASV> And David went thence to Mizpeh in Moab, and said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth amongst you, till I know what God will do for me.
<ASV> So David swore this on oath to Saul, and Saul went to his house, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
<ASV> And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.
<ASV> The Philistines overtook Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
<ASV> She made a vow and said: "O Yahweh of hosts, if you will look with compassion on the misery of your female servant, and will remember me, and not forget your female servant, and will give to your female servant a male child then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and a razor will never pass over his head."
<ASV> And the Lord sent a very evil spirit between Abimelech and the inhabitants of Sichem: who began to detest him,
<ASV> And Abimelech went to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
<ASV> and now, bear, I pray thee, with my sin, and turn back with me, and I bow myself to Jehovah.'
<ASV> And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted and said, May the king live.
<ASV> And Saul saith to his servants who are standing by him, `Hear, I pray you, ye Benjamites; also to all of you doth the son of Jesse give fields and vineyards! all of you he doth appoint heads of thousands and heads of hundreds!
<ASV> For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Juda: in which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
<ASV> So Achish called David and said to him, "As Yahweh lives, certainly you were honest, and I am pleased to have you marching with me in the campaign. For I have not found any wrong in you from the day you came to me until this day, but in the eyes of the rulers, you are not good.
<ASV> And Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's brethren, and spoke to them, and to all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
<ASV> And the men of Israel turn in battle, and Benjamin hath begun to smite the wounded among the men of Israel, about thirty men, for they said, `Surely they are utterly smitten before us, as  the first battle;
<ASV> And it came to pass when Israel sowed, that Midian came up, and Amalek, and the children of the east, and came up against them.
<ASV> And the children of Israel being moved with repentance for their brother Benjamin, began to say: One tribe is taken away from Israel.
<ASV> And now, see, the king is before you: and I am old and grey-headed, and my sons are with you: I have been living before your eyes from my early days till now.
<ASV> And this  the thing which ye do; every male, and every woman knowing the lying of a male, ye devote.'
<ASV> and he saith, `Peace; to sacrifice to Jehovah I have come, sanctify yourselves, and ye have come in with me to the sacrifice;' and he sanctifieth Jesse and his sons, and calleth them to the sacrifice.
<ASV> But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
<ASV> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
<ASV> And Samuel said to Saul, You have done a foolish thing: you have not kept the rules which the Lord your God gave you; it was the purpose of the Lord to make your authority over Israel safe for ever.
<ASV> And the man, the master of the house, goeth out unto them, and saith unto them, `Nay, my brethren, do not evil, I pray you, after that this man hath come in unto my house, do not this folly;
<ASV> What shall we do for wives for them that remain? since we have sworn by Jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters for wives.

<ASV> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
<ASV> And he answered him: Why askest thou my name, which is wonderful?
<ASV> The Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim; and Israel was very distressed.
<ASV> Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
<ASV> That the Lord called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.
<ASV> For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.
<ASV> And Samuel saith to the cook, `Give the portion which I gave to thee, of which I said unto thee, `Set it by thee?'
<ASV> and having fallen away, again to renew  to reformation, having crucified again to themselves the Son of God, and exposed to public shame.

<ASV> Before the lamp of God went out, Samuel slept in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was.
<ASV> And Jonathan son of Saul riseth, and goeth unto David to the forest, and strengtheneth his hand in God,

<ASV> Yahweh said to Samuel, "Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me as the king over them.
<ASV> Then David ran, stood over the Philistine, took his sword, drew it out of its sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
<ASV> And it came to pass after a time, in the days of the wheat-harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid of the goats. And he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber; but her father would not suffer him to go in.

<ASV> And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were found with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin; and the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
<ASV> I also will not henceforth dispossess from before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
<ASV> Jonathan, Saul's son, arose, and went to David into the woods, and strengthened his hand in God.
<ASV> But the Lord said to Samuel, Do not take note of his face or how tall he is, because I will not have him: for the Lord's view is not man's; man takes note of the outer form, but the Lord sees the heart.
<ASV> David left the baggage he had with him in the care of the baggage keeper, ran to the battle line, and came and asked how his brothers were doing.

<ASV> That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
<ASV> And the Lord said to them: Did not the Egyptians and the Amorrhites, and the children of Ammon and the Philistines,

<ASV> (And she had her seat under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her to be judged.)
<ASV> And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
<ASV> And the princes of the Philistines came to her, and said: Deceive him, and learn of him wherein his great strength lieth, and how we may be able to overcome him, to bind and afflict him: which if thou shalt do, we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.
<ASV> And he made an attack on them from Aroer all the way to Minnith, overrunning twenty towns, as far as Abel-cheramim, and put great numbers to the sword. So the children of Ammon were crushed before the children of Israel.
<ASV> But thy kingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought him a man according to his own heart: and him hath the Lord commanded to be prince over his people, because thou hast not observed that which the Lord commanded.
<ASV> And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.
<ASV> A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,
<ASV> Now Samuel did not yet know Yahweh, and the word of Yahweh had not yet been revealed to him.
<ASV> And his companion answereth and saith, `This is nothing save the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel; God hath given into his hand Midian and all the camp.'
<ASV> Joash said to all who stood against him, "Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? He who will contend for him, let him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because someone has broken down his altar!"
<ASV> but remaining in the flesh  more necessary for your sakes;
<ASV> And he will appoint of them to be his tribunes, and centurions, and to plough his fields, and to reap his corn, and to make him arms and chariots.
<ASV> And when the day of battle was come, there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan, except Saul and Jonathan his son.
<ASV> Zebulun is a people who scorned death, and Naphtali, on the heights of the field.
<ASV> And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines which was in Gabaa. And when the Philistines had heard of it, Saul sounded the trumpet over all the land, saying: Let the Hebrews hear.
<ASV> And Saul sendeth messengers to take David, and they see the assembly of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing, set over them, and the Spirit of God is on Saul's messengers, and they prophesy -- they also.
<ASV> He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.
<ASV> And the five men, those going to traverse the land of Laish, answer and say unto their brethren, `Have ye known that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and graven image, and molten image? and now, know what ye do.'
<ASV> So all Israel went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his ploughshare, and his spade, and his axe, and his rake.
<ASV> And this I pray: that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment,
<ASV> And they rise and go to Ziph before Saul, and David and his men  in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain, at the south of the desolate place.
<ASV> And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.
<ASV> and rise against me do the masters of Gibeah -- and they go round the house against me by night -- me they thought to slay, and my concubine they have humbled, and she dieth;
<ASV> And Jonathan said to his young servant who had his arms, Come, let us go over to the armies of these men who have no circumcision: it may be that the Lord will give us help, for there is no limit to his power; the Lord is able to give salvation by a great army or by a small band.
<ASV> And the Spirit of Jehovah was upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah gave Chushan-rishathaim king of Syria into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.
<ASV> `And Israel sendeth messengers unto Sihon, king of the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and Israel saith to him, Let us pass over, we pray thee, through thy land, unto my place,
<ASV> And Saul, balancing the spear in his hand, said, I will give David a blow, pinning him to the wall. And David got away from him twice.
<ASV> And Nob, the town of the priests, he put to the sword, all the men and women, children and babies at the breast, and oxen and asses and sheep.
<ASV> Achish answered David, "I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God. Notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.'
<ASV> His return was to Ramah, for his house was there; and he judged Israel there; and he built an altar to Yahweh there.
<ASV> All the lords of Shechem and Beth-Millo gathered, and they went and made Abimelech as king, near the oak of the pillar that is at Shechem.
<ASV> So the servants of Saul informed him, saying, "This is what David said."
<ASV> Now I desire to have you know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News;
<ASV> And they gave up the Lord, and became the servants of Baal and the Astartes.
<ASV> And Gideon saith unto them, `I do not rule over you, nor doth my son rule over you; Jehovah doth rule over you.'
<ASV> Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, those of all the army of the children of the east who were still living; for a hundred and twenty thousand of their swordsmen had been put to death.
<ASV> And the evil spirit from the Lord was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.
<ASV> Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.
<ASV> Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and put his army in position against Thebez and took it.
<ASV> Then I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and villany in Israel.
<ASV> and the ark of God hath been taken, and the two sons of Eli have died, Hophni and Phinehas.
<ASV> Then Samuel said, "Is there as much delight for Yahweh in burnt offerings and sacrifices as there is in obeying Yahweh? Look! To obey is better than sacrifice; to give heed than the fat of rams.
<ASV> and his concubine, who  in Shechem, hath born to him -- even she -- a son, and he appointeth his name Abimelech.
<ASV> The five chiefs of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites and the Zidonians and the Hivites living in Mount Lebanon, from the mountain Baal-hermon as far as Hamath:
<ASV> For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
<ASV> Then Abigail got up quickly and went on her ass, with five of her young women, after the men whom David had sent; and she became David's wife.
<ASV> And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
<ASV> Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
<ASV> for whom the Lord doth love He doth chasten, and He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;'
<ASV> So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me David your son who is with the sheep."
<ASV> It is for your training that you undergo these things; God is acting to you as a father does to his sons; for what son does not have punishment from his father?
<ASV> And the three hundred men nevertheless persisted sounding the trumpets. And the Lord sent the sword into all the camp, and they killed one another,
<ASV> By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.
<ASV> Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Get up yourself, and strike us, for as is the man, so is his power." So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.
<ASV> And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and serve the Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the Bene-Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsake Jehovah, and have not served Him;
<ASV> Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.
<ASV> In those days there was no king in Israel, and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for themselves an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day [their lot] had not fallen to them for inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
<ASV> So the Israelites dispersed from there at that time according to tribe and family; and they went out from there, each one to their own territory.
<ASV> Why then didn't you obey Yahweh's voice, but took the plunder, and did that which was evil in Yahweh's sight?"
<ASV> and they turn and go, and put the infants, and the cattle, and the baggage, before them.
<ASV> And after this they consulted the Lord whether he would come thither. And the Lord answered: Behold he is hidden at home.
<ASV> But he made himself as nothing, taking the form of a servant, being made like men;
<ASV> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli marked her mouth.
<ASV> And the people of Bethel came and sat there until evening before God, and they lifted their voices and wept bitterly.
<ASV> He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was chosen. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen; but when they looked for him, he could not be found.
<ASV> I pray thee, forgive the transgression of thy handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a lasting house; because my lord fights the battles of Jehovah, and evil has not been found in thee all thy days.
<ASV> And the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God, very terrible; but I did not ask him whence he was, neither did he tell me his name.
<ASV> The angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said: The Lord is with thee, O most valiant of men.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Samuel, See, I will do a thing in Israel at which the ears of everyone hearing of it will be burning.
<ASV> And Caleb said: He that shall take Cariath-Sepher, and lay it waste, to him will I give my daughter Axa to wife.
<ASV> After this, you will come to the Gibeah of God, where there are sentries of the Philistines. Just as you enter the town there, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place, with harp, tambourine, flute, and zither before them, and they will be prophesying.
<ASV> Then Samson said to them, This time I will give payment in full to the Philistines, for I am going to do them great evil.
<ASV> And as for the asses that thou didst lose three days ago, set not thy heart on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel ? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?
<ASV> David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had certainly come.
<ASV> But he turned back from the sculptured stones that were near Gilgal, and he said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." And he said, "Silence!" So all those standing in his presence went out,
<ASV> And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
<ASV> And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.
<ASV> But to which of the angels has he ever said, "Sit down at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."
<ASV> But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
<ASV> Lifting the poor out of the dust, and him who is in need out of the lowest place, to give them their place among rulers, and for their heritage the seat of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's and he has made them the base of the world.
<ASV> Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the failing knees;
<ASV> Is the wheat harvest not today? I will call out to Yahweh so that he still sends thunder and rain, so that you will know and will see that your wickedness is great that you have done in the eyes of Yahweh by asking for a king for yourselves."
<ASV> And after some days returning to take her, he went aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold there was a swarm of bees in the mouth of the lion and a honeycomb.
<ASV> And the servants of Saul said to him: Behold now an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
<ASV> Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.
<ASV> I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
<ASV> Have they not found, divided the booty, A damsel, two damsels, to each? A booty of dyed stuffs for Sisera, A booty of dyed stuffs of embroidery, Dyed stuff of double embroidery for the neck of a spoiler?
<ASV> And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they pillaged their camps.
<ASV> And he said to them: Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
<ASV> Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision.
<ASV> And Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to make war against them; and Yahweh gave them into his hand.
<ASV> This day the Lord will give you up into my hands, and I will overcome you, and take your head off you; and I will give the bodies of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth today, so that all the earth may see that Israel has a God;
<ASV> And the people were true to the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the responsible men who were still living after the death of Joshua, and had seen all the great work of the Lord which he had done for Israel.
<ASV> And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
<ASV> not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as you see the Day approaching.
<ASV> And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered:
<ASV> They got up early, and as dawn was breaking, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, "Get up, so that I can send you away." So Saul got up and the two of them, he and Samuel, went outside.
<ASV> and the princes of the Philistines come up unto her, and say to her, `Entice him, and see wherein his great power , and wherein we are able for him -- and we have bound him to afflict him, and we -- we give to thee, each one, eleven hundred silverlings.'
<ASV> And an angel of Jehovah came and sat under the terebinth that was in Ophrah, that  to Joash the Abi-ezrite. And his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, to secure  from the Midianites.
<ASV> And that every tongue may give witness that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
<ASV> And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.
<ASV> Now there was a certain man of Saraa, and of the race of Dan, whose name was Manue, and his wife was barren.
<ASV> For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf,
<ASV> And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart; and the damsel's father said to his son-in-law, Refresh thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterwards ye may go your way.
<ASV> And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
<ASV> Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.
<ASV> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
<ASV> So God subdued on that day Jabin king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
<ASV> He went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then God's Spirit came on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
<ASV> Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
<ASV> Euodia I exhort, and Syntyche I exhort, to be of the same mind in the Lord;
<ASV> And all the coasts thereof from the Arnon to the Jaboc, and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
<ASV> David pursued, he and four hundred men; but two hundred men stayed because they were too exhausted to pass over the Wadi Besor.
<ASV> And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.
<ASV> He will take your male slaves and your female slaves and the best of your young men and your donkeys and will use them for his projects.
<ASV> And David said to him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
<ASV> Then Saul and all the people that were with him, shouted together, and they came to the place of the fight: and behold every man's sword was turned upon his neighbour, and there was a very great slaughter.
<ASV> So Samuel called out to Yahweh, and Yahweh brought thunder and rain that same day, so all the people feared Yahweh and Samuel greatly.
<ASV> For I have declared to him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he hath known: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
<ASV> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?
<ASV> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but in all boldness, as always, now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death.
<ASV> But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make the man return, that he may go again to his place where thou hast appointed him, that he go not down with us to the battle, that in the battle he be not an adversary to us; for wherewith should this  reconcile himself to his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?
<ASV> And Saul disguiseth himself and putteth on other garments, and goeth, he and two of the men with him, and they come in unto the woman by night, and he saith, `Divine, I pray thee, to me by the familiar spirit, and cause to come up to me him whom I say unto thee.'
<ASV> the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet hath been manifested the way of the holy , the first tabernacle having yet a standing;
<ASV> All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.
<ASV> For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.
<ASV> But Samuel said, "What have you done?" Saul said, "Because I saw that the army was scattering from me and you did not come at the appointed time and that the Philistines had gathered at Micmash,
<ASV> He said to them, "Follow me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand." They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn't allow any man to pass over.
<ASV> And began to go towards the way of the desert, the enemy pursuing them thither also. And they that fired the city came also out to meet them.
<ASV> Then all the wicked and unjust men that had gone with David answering, said: Because they came not with us, we will not give them any thing of the prey which we have recovered: but let every man take his wife and his children, and be contented with them, and go his way.
<ASV> Now when he was come to the place of the Jawbone, and the Philistines shouting went to meet him, the spirit of the Lord came strongly upon him: and as the flax is wont to be consumed at the approach of fire, so the bands with which he was bound were broken and loosed.
<ASV> And when he saw her he was overcome with grief, and said, Ah! my daughter! I am crushed with sorrow, and it is you who are the chief cause of my trouble; for I have made an oath to the Lord and I may not take it back.
<ASV> And Eli, hearing the noise and the cries, said, What is the reason of this outcry? And the man came quickly and gave the news to Eli.
<ASV> Then David thought to himself, "Now I will perish one day by the hand of Saul! There is nothing better for me but that I must certainly escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will desist from searching for me further in all of the territories of Israel, and so I will escape from his hand."
<ASV> and she saith, `O, my lord, thy soul liveth! my lord, I  the woman who stood with thee in this , to pray unto Jehovah;
<ASV> For when the people were numbered, not one man of the people of Jabesh-gilead was present.
<ASV> and he leadeth them before the king of Moab, and they dwell with him all the days of David's being in the fortress.
<ASV> Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
<ASV> Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Please bring the ephod here for me." So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.

<ASV> Not giving up our meetings, as is the way of some, but keeping one another strong in faith; and all the more because you see the day coming near.
<ASV> and not terrified in anything by those opposing, which to them indeed is a token of destruction, and to you of salvation, and that from God;
<ASV> And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he repeated them in the ears of Jehovah.
<ASV> And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.
<ASV> So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had treated him shamefully.
<ASV> David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
<ASV> So now, let it be given out to the people that anyone who is shaking with fear is to go back from Mount Galud. So twenty-two thousand of the people went back, but there were still ten thousand.
<ASV> And she said: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And awaking from sleep, he said in his mind: I will go out as I did before, and shake myself, not knowing that the Lord was departed from him.
<ASV> But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
<ASV> And it came to pass, as the flame went up from off the altar towards the heavens, that the Angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar; and Manoah and his wife looked on, and fell on their faces to the ground.
<ASV> Then Yahweh said to Samuel, "How long will you mourn about Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel! Fill up your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen a king for myself among his sons."
<ASV> And Samuel said to Saul: Thou hast done foolishly, and hast not kept the commandments of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee. And if thou hadst not done thus, the Lord would now have established thy kingdom over Israel for ever.
<ASV> After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,
<ASV> Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus,
<ASV> Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
<ASV> But strong meat is for the perfect; for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil.
<ASV> Samson said to her, "If you tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that are not dried up, I will become weak like everyone else."
<ASV> And about dawn Samuel said to Saul on the roof, Get up so that I may send you away. So Saul got up, and he and Samuel went out together.
<ASV> The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
<ASV> And he saith to his young man, `Come, and we draw near to one of the places, and have lodged in Gibeah, or in Ramah.'
<ASV> They answered: We will give them most willingly. And spreading a mantle on the ground, they cast upon it the earlets of the spoils.
<ASV> And taking prisoner a young man of the people of Succoth, he got from him, in answer to his questions, a list of the chiefs of Succoth and the responsible men, seventy-seven men.
<ASV> And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.
<ASV> Let brotherly love continue.
<ASV> And Saul's son Jonathan went to David in Horesh, and made his hands strong in God;
<ASV> But Nabal answered David's servants and said, "Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? Today, there are many servants breaking away from the presence of their masters.
<ASV> For he who makes holy and those who are made holy are all of one family; and for this reason it is no shame for him to give them the name of brothers,
<ASV> And Saul chose him three thousand men out of Israel: there were with Saul two thousand in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin; and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
<ASV> And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.
<ASV> Thus the Christ also has not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, *Thou* art my Son, *I* have to-day begotten thee.
<ASV> Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, with the Bishops and Deacons of the church:
<ASV> And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
<ASV> And Achish trusted David, saying, He has made himself utterly odious among his people Israel; and he shall be my servant for ever.

<ASV> And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.
<ASV> looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may give trouble, and through this many may be defiled;
<ASV> And Jonathan said to David, Jehovah, God of Israel, when I sound my father about this time to-morrow,  the next day, and behold, there be good toward David, and I then send not to thee, and apprise thee of it,
<ASV> By faith he celebrated the pasch, and the shedding of the blood; that he, who destroyed the firstborn, might not touch them.
<ASV> But the just shall live by faith; and, if he draw back, my soul does not take pleasure in him.
<ASV> And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth by Ramah.
<ASV> And he said to them, Thus and thus has Micah done to me; and he has hired me, and I am his priest.
<ASV> The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
<ASV> So he went there to Naioth in Ramah and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
<ASV> They said to the messengers who came, "Tell the men of Jabesh Gilead, 'Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will be rescued.'" The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
<ASV> Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
<ASV> By faith Abel made a better offering to God than Cain, and he had witness through it of his righteousness, God giving his approval of his offering: and his voice still comes to us through it though he is dead.
<ASV> Then said David, O Lord God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
<ASV> The men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will come out to you and you may do to us whatever seems good to you."
<ASV> And it came to pass in about ten days that Jehovah smote Nabal, and he died.
<ASV> And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.
<ASV> And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
<ASV> Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.
<ASV> And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
<ASV> And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
<ASV> And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
<ASV> He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.
<ASV> And so David sent out watchers, and got word from them that Saul was certainly coming.
<ASV> And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.
<ASV> Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do what is appropriate for the occasion; for God is with you.
<ASV> Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the Lord of all the righteous acts of the Lord, which he did to you and to your fathers.
<ASV> And it cometh to pass at his completing to cause the burnt-offering to ascend, that lo, Samuel hath come, and Saul goeth out to meet him, to bless him;
<ASV> And his father goeth down unto the woman, and Samson maketh there a banquet, for so the young men do;
<ASV> Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek." He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.
<ASV> And she said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And he woke up from his sleep and said, "I will go out just like every other time and shake myself free," but he did not know that Yahweh had left him.
<ASV> Here, then, is the king marked out by you: the Lord has put a king over you.
<ASV> and she brought it near before Saul, and before his servants, and they ate. And they rose up and went away that night.
<ASV> And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
<ASV> And on their way down to the end of the town, Samuel said to Saul, Give your servant orders to go on in front of us, (so he went on,) but you keep here, so that I may give you the word of God.
<ASV> The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What wickedness is this that is happen among you?
<ASV> (and the six hundred men girded with their weapons of war, who  of the sons of Dan, are standing at the opening of the gate), --
<ASV> So David recovered all that the Amalecites had taken, and he rescued his two wives.
<ASV> And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He selleth them into the hand of Chushan-Rishathaim king of Aram-Naharaim, and the sons of Israel serve Chushan-Rishathaim eight years;
<ASV> I thank my God for my whole remembrance of you,
<ASV> Then Jephthah got together all the men of Gilead and made war on Ephraim; and the men of Gilead overcame Ephraim.
<ASV> And David taketh the head of the Philistine, and bringeth it in to Jerusalem, and his weapons he hath put in his own tent.
<ASV> And lo, Barak is pursuing Sisera, and Jael cometh out to meet him, and saith to him, `Come, and I shew thee the man whom thou art seeking;' and he cometh in unto her, and lo, Sisera is fallen -- dead, and the pin in his temples.
<ASV> So he showed them the entrance of the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let go the man and all his family.
<ASV> Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.
<ASV> And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
<ASV> and there hath been the file for mattocks, and for coulters, and for three-pronged rakes, and for the axes, and to set up the goads.
<ASV> Now the children of Israel had also sworn in Maspha, saying: None of us shall give of his daughters to the children of Benjamin to wife.
<ASV> The children of Dan sent five men of their family from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it. They said to them, "Go, explore the land!" They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
<ASV> And Elcana her husband said to her: Do what seemeth good to thee, and stay till thou wean him: and I pray that the Lord may fulfill his word. So the woman stayed at home, and gave her son suck, till she weaned him.
<ASV> For consider the one who endured such hostility by sinners against himself, so that you will not grow weary in your souls and give up.
<ASV> And it came to pass when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.
<ASV> Now Galaad had a wife of whom he had sons: who after they were grown up, thrust out Jephte, saying: Thou canst not inherit in the house of our father, because thou art born of another mother.
<ASV> And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.
<ASV> and he saith to me, Lo, thou art pregnant, and bearing a son, and now do not drink wine and strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing, for a Nazarite to God is the youth from the womb till the day of his death.'
<ASV> Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.
<ASV> Moreover, the Glory of Israel will not break faith and will not regret, for he is not a human that he should regret."
<ASV> And they gathered together to Masphath: and they drew water, and poured it out before the Lord, and they fasted on that day, and they said there: We have sinned against the Lord. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Masphath.
<ASV> And her husband followed her, willing to be reconciled with her, and to speak kindly to her, and to bring her back with him, having with him a servant and two asses: and she received him, and brought him into her father's house. And when his father in law had heard this, and had seen him, he met him with joy,
<ASV> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the open place of the city; and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
<ASV> Rather choosing to be afflicted with the people of God, than to have the pleasure of sin for a time,
<ASV> Then he said to her, "What is his appearance?" She said, "An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe." Then Saul realized that it was Samuel, and he knelt with his face to the ground and bowed down.
<ASV> And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.
<ASV> And the men of Israel have seen that they are distressed, that the people hath been oppressed, and the people hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
<ASV> (Nor were the children of Benjamin ignorant that the children of Israel were come up to Maspha.) And the Levite the husband of the woman that was killed, being asked, how so great a wickedness had been committed,
<ASV> Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that Jehovah had given thee this day into my hand in the cave; and they bade me kill thee; but [mine eye] spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord, for he is the anointed of Jehovah.
<ASV> And returning from the battle before the sun rising,
<ASV> Because it was right for him, for whom and through whom all things have being, in guiding his sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation complete through pain.
<ASV> Now the Philistines assembled all their forces at Aphek, and Israel was encamped at the spring that is in Jezreel.
<ASV> And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, Jehovah has not chosen these.
<ASV> And David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee to this day, that I should not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
<ASV> And now, my lord,  Jehovah liveth, and  thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah has restrained thee from coming with bloodshed, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
<ASV> Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest.
<ASV> Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by him; always living to make intercession for us.
<ASV> Also before they make perfume with the fat -- then hath the priest's servant come in, and said to the man who is sacrificing, `Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he doth not take of thee flesh boiled, but raw;'
<ASV> Then Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child became the servant of the Lord under the direction of Eli the priest.
<ASV> And Manasseh did not take away the land of the people of Beth-shean and its daughter-towns, or of Taanach and its daughter-towns, or of the people of Dor and its daughter-towns, or of the people of Ibleam and its daughter-towns, or of the people of Megiddo and its daughter-towns, driving them out; but the Canaanites would go on living in that land.
<ASV> (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say: "Come, let us go up to the seer." For the prophet of today was formerly called a seer.)
<ASV> He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked will be destroyed in the darkness, because a man will not prevail by his might.
<ASV> Then Saul said to his servants that stood by him, Hear now, ye Benjaminites: will the son of Jesse give every one of you also fields and vineyards? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
<ASV> Filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
<ASV> In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
<ASV> So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.
<ASV> Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways,
<ASV> But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore its name was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi, to this day.
<ASV> And when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he disdained him; for he was a youth, and ruddy, and besides of a beautiful countenance.
<ASV> And Saul said to Jonathan: Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said: I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod, which was in my hand, and behold I must die.
<ASV> and there is no deliverer, for it  far off from Zidon, and they have no word with  man, and it  in the valley which  by Beth-Rehob; and they build the city, and dwell in it,
<ASV> And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the Lord.
<ASV> lo, ye  all sons of Israel; give for you a word and counsel here.'
<ASV> Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.
<ASV> And David arose, and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
<ASV> lest any one be a fornicator, or a profane person, as Esau, who in exchange for one morsel of food did sell his birthright,
<ASV> and changeth his behaviour before their eyes, and feigneth himself mad in their hand, and scribbleth on the doors of the gate, and letteth down his spittle unto his beard.
<ASV> And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
<ASV> And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.
<ASV> And he inquired of Jehovah for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
<ASV> And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
<ASV> For ye came not near to the mount touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
<ASV> And Dalila said to him: How dost thou say thou lovest me, when thy mind is not with me? Thou hast told me lies these three times, and wouldst not tell me wherein thy great strength lieth.
<ASV> But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
<ASV> And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?
<ASV> And they called to the descendants of Dan, who turned around to face them, and they said to Micah, "What is the matter with you that you assembled together?"
<ASV> And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.
<ASV> The descendants of Hobab the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the descendants of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the Negev near Arad. And they went and settled with the people.
<ASV> When they saw him, they took thirty companions, and they were with him.
<ASV> And Saul said, Hear now, son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
<ASV> And Saul fell straightway his full length on the earth, and was sore afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night.
<ASV> The priest said to them, "Go in peace. Your way in which you go is before Yahweh."
<ASV> by so much more Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
<ASV> And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that smites this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
<ASV> who is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, sustaining all things by the word of power. When he had made purification for sins through him, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
<ASV> Saul said, "You are blessed by Yahweh; for you have had compassion on me.
<ASV> Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
<ASV> Now Eli was ninety-eight years old. His eyes were set, so that he could not see.
<ASV> and as it is laid up to men once to die, and after this -- judgment,
<ASV> And he said to them: What you shall see me do, do you the same: I will go into one part of the camp, and do you as I shall do.
<ASV> And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
<ASV> He acted bravely and defeated the Amalekites and rescued Israel from the hand of those who plundered it.
<ASV> Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, "Yahweh has not chosen these."
<ASV> Samuel said to Jesse, "Are all your children here?" He said, "There remains yet the youngest. Behold, he is keeping the sheep." Samuel said to Jesse, "Send and get him, for we will not sit down until he comes here."
<ASV> And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
<ASV> So then, this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against her by lot.
<ASV> And the Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?
<ASV> and to those in Rachal, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those in the cities of the Kenites,
<ASV> And she said, Oh my lord,  thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here to pray to Jehovah.
<ASV> He said to her, "If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man."
<ASV> And Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David: and Saul had word of it and was pleased.
<ASV> As to the asses which are lost to thee this day three days, set not thy heart to them, for they have been found; and to whom  all the desire of Israel?' is it not to thee and to all thy father's house?'
<ASV> And the sons of Israel ask of Jehovah, -- and there  the ark of the covenant of God in those days,
<ASV> They were near Jebus, and the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
<ASV> and Micah saith, `Now I have known that Jehovah doth good to me, for the Levite hath been to me for a priest.'
<ASV> When he returned the pieces of silver to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and she gave it to the smith, and he made it into an idol of cast metal; and it was in the house of Micah.
<ASV> For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
<ASV> And the Bene-Ammon are called together, and encamp in Gilead, and the sons of Israel are gathered together, and encamp in Mizpah.
<ASV> who doesn't need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all, when he offered up himself.
<ASV> And Heber the Kenite was separated from the other Kenites, that is, from the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses. And he was encamped at Elon-bezaanannim, which is near Kedesh.
<ASV> And they send and gather all the princes of the Philistines unto them, and say, `What do we do to the ark of the God of Israel?' and they say, `To Gath let the ark of the God of Israel be brought round;' and they bring round the ark of the God of Israel;
<ASV> And the vine said to them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave over the trees?
<ASV> Therefore arise in the morning, thou, and the servants of thy lord, who came with thee: and when you are up before day, and it shall begin to be light, go on your way.
<ASV> It will happen, that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say, "Please put me into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread."'"
<ASV> So they turned to that direction, and they came to the house of the young Levite, the house of Micah, and they greeted him.
<ASV> Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
<ASV> But he, whose pedigree is not numbered among them, received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
<ASV> David was the youngest; and the three oldest followed Saul.
<ASV> They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, "Send the ark of the God of Israel away, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people." For there was a deadly confusion throughout all the city. The hand of God was very heavy there.
<ASV> He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put trumpets and empty jars in everyone's hand, with torches inside the jars.
<ASV> And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.
<ASV> and he calleth hastily unto the young man bearing his weapons, and saith to him, `Draw thy sword, and thou hast put me to death, lest they say of me -- A woman slew him;' and his young man pierced him through, and he dieth.
<ASV> and it cometh to pass at the end of two months that she turneth back unto her father, and he doth to her his vow which he hath vowed, and she knew not a man; and it is a statute in Israel:
<ASV> Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
<ASV> What are we to do about wives for those who are still living? For we have taken an oath by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters for wives.
<ASV> Gideon said to him, "Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, 'Didn't Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?' But now Yahweh has cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian."
<ASV> And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
<ASV> And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the Lord's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
<ASV> So the children of Israel dwelt in the midst of the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite:
<ASV> And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
<ASV> Then Achish called David, and said to him, "As Yahweh lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, the lords don't favor you.

<ASV> And Jehovah smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjaminites that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men: all these drew the sword.

<ASV> And Michal daughter of Saul loveth David, and they declare to Saul, and the thing is right in his eyes,

<ASV> Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
<ASV> And when the second day after the new moon was come, David's place appeared empty again. And Saul said to Jonathan his son: Why cometh not the son of Isai to meat neither yesterday nor to day?
<ASV> So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head; and they went away: and no man saw it, or knew it, nor did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Yahweh was fallen on them.
<ASV> that Jehovah sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;

<ASV> And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.

<ASV> and kindleth fire in the torches, and sendeth  out into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burneth  from heap even unto standing corn, even unto vineyard -- olive-yard.
<ASV> And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.

<ASV> I will not again drive out anyone from before them from the nations that Joshua left when he died,
<ASV> And when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the goods to the responsible men of Judah, and to his friends, saying, Here is an offering for you from the goods of those who were fighting against the Lord;

<ASV> And David saith to Saul, `Why dost thou hear the words of man, saying, Lo, David is seeking thine evil?

<ASV> Samuel said, "What have you done?" Saul said, "Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn't come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;

<ASV> Then I will send word to my servant, 'Go, find the arrows!' If I clearly say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring it,' then come, for it means peace for you. And there is no problem, as Yahweh lives.
<ASV> So she wept before him the seven days of the feast: and at length on the seventh day as she was troublesome to him, he expounded it. And she immediately told her countrymen.
<ASV> Manasses also did not destroy Bethsan, and Thanac with their villages, nor the inhabitants of Dor, and Jeblaam, and Mageddo with their villages. And the Chanaanite began to dwell with them.
<ASV> And Samuel said: Why askest thou me, seeing the Lord has departed from thee, and is gone over to thy rival:
<ASV> See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:
<ASV> Now there was a certain man in the wilderness of Maon, and his possessions were in Carmel, and the man was very great: and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and it happened that he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
<ASV> So David was hid in the field, and the new moon came, and the king sat down to eat bread.
<ASV> And the five princes of the Philistines saw, and they returned to Accaron the same day.
<ASV> Forgive the iniquity of thy handmaid: for the Lord will surely make for my lord a faithful house, because thou, my lord, fightest the battles of the Lord: let not evil therefore be found in thee all the days of thy life.
<ASV> And David went wherever Saul sent him, and did wisely: and Saul put him at the head of his men of war, and this was pleasing to all the people as well as to Saul's servants.

<ASV> Then David inquired of Yahweh yet again. Yahweh answered him, and said, "Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand."
<ASV> Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen.
<ASV> again he ordains a certain day, today, speaking by David after so long a time, just as had been said before, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."
<ASV> And he left them under the eyes of the king of Moab, and they abode with him all the days that David was in the hold.
<ASV> And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
<ASV> They will perish, but you continue. They all will grow old like a garment does.
<ASV> So Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me in the bed, so that I can kill him."
<ASV> The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, "What shall we do with Yahweh's ark? Show us how we should send it to its place."
<ASV> He said, "You took away my gods that I had made, and the priest, and then you go away. What is now left for me? How can you say to me, 'What is the matter?'"
<ASV> And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said to him, Take the young bullock, which thy father hath, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it;
<ASV> Delilah realized that he had confided in her, so she sent and called the rulers of the Philistines, saying, "Come up one more time, for he has confided in me." And the rulers of the Philistines came up, and they brought the money with them.
<ASV> thus doth God do to the enemies of David, and thus He doth add, if I leave of all that he hath till the light of the morning -- of those sitting on the wall.'
<ASV> Aren't they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
<ASV> Now the child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Heli, and the word of the Lord was precious in those days, there was no manifest vision.
<ASV> Then the children of Israel went away from there, every man to his tribe and his family, every man went back to his heritage.
<ASV> Deborah said to Barak, "Go; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn't Yahweh gone out before you?" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

<ASV> But when the leader died they relapsed and acted corruptly, more than their ancestors, following other gods, serving them, and bowing down to them. They would not give up their deeds or their stubborn ways.
<ASV> and the people serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who prolonged days after Joshua, who saw all the great work of Jehovah which He did to Israel.
<ASV> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord.
<ASV> which we have like an anchor of the soul, both firm and steadfast, and entering into the inside of the curtain,
<ASV> `And, now, know and consider what thou dost; for evil hath been determined against our lord, and against all his house, and he  too much a son of worthlessness to be spoken to.'
<ASV> He said to her, "What does he look like?" She said, "An old man comes up. He is covered with a robe." Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and showed respect.
<ASV> The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
<ASV> And David came to the two hundred men, who being weary had stayed, and were not able to follow David, and he had ordered them to abide at the torrent Besor: and they came out to meet David, and the people that were with him. And David coming to the people saluted them peaceably.
<ASV> And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they went away, every man to his place.

<ASV> So the children of Dan sent five most valiant men of their stock and family from Saraa and Esthaol, to spy out the land, and to view it diligently: and they said to them: Go, and view the land.

<ASV> And Saul made an attack on the Amalekites from Havilah on the road to Shur, which is before Egypt.

<ASV> And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
<ASV> She named the child Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel"; because God's ark was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
<ASV> I thought thou hadst hated her, and therefore I gave her to thy friend: but she hath a sister, who is younger and fairer than she, take her to wife instead of her.
<ASV> And after him came Shamgar, the son of Anath, who put to death six hundred Philistines with an ox-stick; and he was another saviour of Israel.
<ASV> being able to exercise forbearance towards the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is clothed with infirmity;
<ASV> and the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he rent it as one rends a kid, and nothing was in his hand. And he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.
<ASV> And one of the people answering, said: Thy father hath bound the people with an oath, saying: Cursed be the man that shall eat any food this day. (And the people were faint.)
<ASV> and did taste the good saying of God, the powers also of the coming age,
<ASV> He hath come unto Lehi -- and the Philistines have shouted at meeting him -- and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him, and the thick bands which  on his arms are as flax which they burn with fire, and his bands are wasted from off his hands,
<ASV> Moreover the Hebrews that had been with the Philistines yesterday and the day before, and went up with them into the camp, returned to be with the Israelites, who were with Saul and Jonathan.

<ASV> And the Philistines are afraid, for they said, `God hath come in unto the camp;' and they say, `Wo to us, for there hath not been like this heretofore.

<ASV> and Abimelech son of Jerubbaal goeth to Shechem, unto his mother's brethren, and speaketh unto them, and unto all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
<ASV> For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.
<ASV> For if Jesus had brought them into rest, he would not have spoken afterwards about another day.
<ASV> Now David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and lived in Naioth.

<ASV> And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
<ASV> For Yahweh will not forsake his people for the sake of his great name, because Yahweh has decided to make you his own people.
<ASV> And when he was come, Heli sat upon a stool over against the way watching. For his heart was fearful for the ark of God. And when the man was come into the city, he told it: and all the city cried out.
<ASV> And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
<ASV> And David saith unto his heart, `Now am I consumed one day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing for me better than that I diligently escape unto the land of the Philistines, and Saul hath been despairing of me -- of seeking me any more in all the border of Israel, and I have escaped out of his hand.'
<ASV> having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;

<ASV> David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"

<ASV> And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they said, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about .
<ASV> So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.

<ASV> And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, for the king's business was urgent.

<ASV> And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If ye take me back to fight against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah give them up before me, shall I be your head?
<ASV> Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
<ASV> And when Dalila had done this, she said to him: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And awaking out of his sleep he drew out the nail with the hairs and the lace.
<ASV> And those men who were not overtaken by death were cruelly diseased: and the cry of the town went up to heaven.
<ASV> The Hebrews who had been for the Philistines previously, who had gone up with them into the camp all around, even they joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
<ASV> But he answered thus: Behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son: beware thou drink no wine, nor strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite of God from his infancy, from his mother's womb until the day of his death.

<ASV> But a certain woman sent a great stone, such as is used for crushing grain, on to the head of Abimelech, cracking the bone.
<ASV> And the people say unto Samuel, `Who is he that saith, Saul doth reign over us! give ye up the men, and we put them to death.'
<ASV> See that you give ear to his voice which comes to you. For if those whose ears were shut to the voice which came to them on earth did not go free from punishment, what chance have we of going free if we give no attention to him whose voice comes from heaven?
<ASV> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.
<ASV> But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.
<ASV> And Samuel heareth all the words of the people, and speaketh them in the ears of Jehovah;
<ASV> David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the souls of all the people were grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God.
<ASV> By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks.

<ASV> For every house is built by someone, but the one who built all things is God.
<ASV> Then after a time he went back to take her; and turning from the road to see the dead body of the lion, he saw a mass of bees in the body of the lion, and honey there.
<ASV> After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a single flea.
<ASV> Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
<ASV> for a covenant over dead victims  stedfast, since it is no force at all when the covenant-victim liveth,
<ASV> In like manner do *ye* also rejoice, and rejoice with me.
<ASV> So the king sent to summon Ahimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, and all his father's household, the priests who were at Nob. So all of them came to the king.
<ASV> that from year to year the daughters of Israel go to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.
<ASV> saying, "Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you."

<ASV> And he saith, `What  the word which He hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me; so doth God do to thee, and so doth He add, if thou hidest from me a word of all the words that He hath spoken unto thee.'
<ASV> Then he took his stick in his hand, and got five smooth stones from the bed of the stream and put them in a bag such as is used by sheep-keepers; and in his hand was a leather band used for sending stones: and so he went in the direction of the Philistine.
<ASV> Stay with me! Do not fear, because he who seeks my life seeks your life. You are in good care with me."
<ASV> And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.

<ASV> And they passed thence to mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
<ASV> And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.

<ASV> Then they said to him, We have come down to take you and give you up into the hands of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Give me your oath that you will not make an attack on me yourselves.
<ASV> And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house, and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to Jehovah.
<ASV> When Gaal saw the army, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the top of the mountains!" And Zebul said to him, "The shadows of the mountains look like people to you."
<ASV> Remember your leaders who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their conversation, imitate their faith.
<ASV> And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
<ASV> —if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you;
<ASV> On the third day you must go down quickly and go to the place where you hid yourself on the day all this started and remain beside the stone Ezel.
<ASV> and let us consider one another for provoking to love and good works;
<ASV> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.

<ASV> And when I saw this, I put my life in my own hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the Lord delivered them into my hands. What have I deserved, that you should rise up to fight against me?
<ASV> And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
<ASV> By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.

<ASV> And Saul cast the spear, and thought, I will smite David and the wall. But David turned away from him twice.
<ASV> neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.
<ASV> yea, the five men, those going to traverse the land, go up -- they have come in thither -- they have taken the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image -- and the priest is standing at the opening of the gate, and the six hundred men who are girded with weapons of war --

<ASV> Gideon said to him, "Excuse me, my lord. If Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonderful deeds that our ancestors recounted to us, saying, 'Did not Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?' But now Yahweh has forsaken us; he has given us into the palm of Midian."

<ASV> But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: [we go] by lot against it;
<ASV> And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart become feeble because of him; I, your servant, will go out and have a fight with this Philistine.
<ASV> And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render back upon their heads; and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

<ASV> Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

<ASV> But this we will do in common against Gabaa:
<ASV> My brothers, take care that there is not by chance in any one of you an evil heart without belief, turning away from the living God:

<ASV> And Abdon, the son of Hillel, came to his death, and his body was put to rest in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekites.
<ASV> For the order which said, If the mountain is touched even by a beast, the beast is to be stoned, seemed hard to them;
<ASV> Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.
<ASV> So the two of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, and the Philistines said, "The Hebrews are coming out from the holes in which they have hidden themselves."

<ASV> and  a great priest over the house of God,
<ASV> So the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.
<ASV> But if you have fear of going down, take your servant Purah with you and go down to the tents;

<ASV> And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ajalon; and the people were very faint.
<ASV> that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.
<ASV> And the ambush hasted, and fell upon Gibeah; and the ambush drew along, and smote the whole city with the edge of the sword.
<ASV> The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel for twenty years.
<ASV> By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by  word of God, so that that which is seen should not take its origin from things which appear.
<ASV> David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and my mother come out with you, until I know what God will do for me."
<ASV> God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,
<ASV> And Samuel said to the people, The Lord is witness, who gave authority to Moses and Aaron, and who took your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
<ASV> And the priest saith to them, `Go in peace; over-against Jehovah  your way in which ye go.'

<ASV> And Delilah taketh thick bands, new ones, and bindeth him with them, and saith unto him, `Philistines  upon thee, Samson;' and the ambush is abiding in an inner chamber, and he breaketh them from off his arms as a thread.
<ASV> And Judah goeth up, and Jehovah giveth the Canaanite and the Perizzite into their hand, and they smite them in Bezek -- ten thousand men;
<ASV> for your proving the things that differ, that ye may be pure and offenceless -- to a day of Christ,
<ASV> Seeing therefore it remains that some enter into it, and those who first received the glad tidings did not enter in on account of not hearkening to the word,
<ASV> God has given into your hands the chiefs of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; what have I been able to do in comparison with you? And when he said this, their feeling about him became kinder.
<ASV> Never will my hand be stretched out against the man marked with the holy oil; but take the spear which is by his head and the vessel of water, and let us go.
<ASV> And when they forgat the Lord their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.

<ASV> And all the common people came into a forest, in which there was honey upon the ground.
<ASV> And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.
<ASV> Ehud escaped while they waited, passed beyond the stone idols, and escaped to Seirah.
<ASV> But now they desire a better, that is to say, a heavenly country. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.
<ASV> And the Spirit of God doth prosper over Saul, in his hearing these words, and his anger burneth greatly,
<ASV> for of those beasts whose blood is carried [as sacrifices for sin] into the [holy of] holies by the high priest, of these the bodies are burned outside the camp.
<ASV> So that we may be like the other nations, and so that our king may be our judge and go out before us to war.
<ASV> And the Lord also will deliver Israel with thee into the hands of the Philistines: and to morrow thou and thy sons shall be with me: and the Lord will also deliver the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.
<ASV> Let brotherly love abide.
<ASV> So they removed the foreign gods from their midst and served Yahweh; and he could no longer bear the misery of Israel.
<ASV> So Saul said, "Bring here to me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings." Then he offered up the burnt offering.
<ASV> Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.
<ASV> And the Zidonians, and Amalek, and Maon have oppressed you, and ye cry unto Me, and I save you out of their hand;
<ASV> And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
<ASV> And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it; and they called the name of the city Hormah.
<ASV> Now then take care to have no wine or strong drink and to take no unclean thing for food;
<ASV> and they forget Jehovah their God, and He selleth them into the hand of Sisera, head of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fight against them,
<ASV> His request was for water, she gave him milk; she put butter before him on a fair plate.
<ASV> But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;
<ASV> And his three eldest sons followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle, were Eliab the firstborn, and the second Abinadab, and the third Samma.
<ASV> Now therefore beware and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing.
<ASV> Nor the office of the priests to the people: but whosoever had offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest came, while the flesh was in boiling, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand,
<ASV> This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest,
<ASV> Then he said: I have sinned: yet honour me now before the ancients of my people, and before Israel, and return with me, that I may adore the Lord thy God.
<ASV> When they blew the three hundred trumpets, Yahweh set the sword of each one against his neighbor throughout the whole camp, and the camp fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah, up to Abel Meholah, the border by Tabbath.
<ASV> And over it were the winged ones of glory with their wings covering the mercy-seat; about which it is not possible now to say anything in detail.
<ASV> And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
<ASV> Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua; the names of his two daughters were as follows: the name of the firstborn was Merab and the younger was Michal.
<ASV> Samuel said to the people, "It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
<ASV> When these went to Micah's house, they took the divine carved image, ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, and the priest asked them, "What are you doing?"
<ASV> And never again will there be an old man in your family.
<ASV> And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that a certain Levite, sojourning on the further side of mount Ephraim, took him a concubine out of Bethlehem-Judah.
<ASV> When Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel.
<ASV> Samson went down to Gaza; there he saw a prostitute and had sex with her.
<ASV> And it came to pass at the time when Merob the daughter of Saul should have been given to David, that she was given to Hadriel the Molathite to wife.
<ASV> And the Lord heard the prayer of Manue, and the angel of the Lord appeared again to his wife as she was sitting in the field. But Manue her husband was not with her. And when she saw the angel,
<ASV> Ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel came over against Gibeah, and the battle was severe; but they didn't know that disaster was close to them.
<ASV> And he had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent out of the house, and thirty daughters he took in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
<ASV> And there riseth after him Jair the Gileadite, and he judgeth Israel twenty and two years,
<ASV> And she fixeth  with the pin, and saith unto him, `Philistines  upon thee, Samson;' and he awaketh out of his sleep, and journeyeth with the pin of the weaving machine, and with the web.
<ASV> So Israel sent messengers to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon, and they said to him: Suffer me to pass through thy land to the river.
<ASV> But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
<ASV> For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
<ASV> When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted from the donkey, Caleb said to her, "What do you want?"
<ASV> And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
<ASV> So he confided everything to her, and he said to her, "A razor has never touched my head, for I am a Nazirite of God from birth. If I am shaved my strength will leave me, and I will become weak, like everyone else.
<ASV> Jesus Christ  the same yesterday, and to-day, and to the ages [to come].
<ASV> Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;
<ASV> `And, my father, see, yea see the skirt of thine upper robe in my hand; for by cutting off the skirt of thy upper robe, and I have not slain thee, know and see that there is not in my hand evil and transgression, and I have not sinned against thee, and thou art hunting my soul to take it!
<ASV> Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" One said, "Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah."
<ASV> And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying: If you turn to the Lord with all your heart, put away the strange gods from among you, Baalim and Astaroth: and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
<ASV> The Lord chose new wars, and he himself overthrew the gates of the enemies: a shield and spear was not seen among forty thousand of Israel.
<ASV> Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;
<ASV> and most of the brothers, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, dare even more to speak the word without fear.
<ASV> For while the son of Jesse is living on the earth, your position is unsafe and your kingdom is in danger. So make him come here to me, for it is certainly right for him to be put to death.
<ASV> All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.
<ASV> And David said to his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword; and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.
<ASV> and they take their bones, and bury  under the tamarisk in Jabesh, and fast seven days.
<ASV> and the women answer -- those playing, and say, `Saul hath smitten among his thousands, And David among his myriads.'
<ASV> And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give thee yearly ten silver-pieces, and a suit of garments, and thy victuals. And the Levite went in.
<ASV> Samuel said, "Though you were little in your own sight, weren't you made the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;
<ASV> And God was a witness with them, by signs and wonders, and by more than natural powers, and by his distribution of the Holy Spirit at his pleasure.
<ASV> And behold they saw an old man, returning out of the field and from his work in the evening, and he also was of mount Ephraim, and dwelt as a stranger in Gabaa; but the men of that country were the children of Jemini.
<ASV> Gilead beyond the Jordan did tabernacle, And Dan -- why doth he sojourn  ships? Asher hath abode at the haven of the seas, And by his creeks doth tabernacle.
<ASV> And they laid the ark of the Lord upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.
<ASV> So was the first attack in which Jonathan and his armor bearer killed about twenty men within about half of a furrow in an acre of an open field.
<ASV> And the people told him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that smites him.
<ASV> Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we have heard, lest perhaps we should let them slip.
<ASV> So they sent and got together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its place, so that it may not be the cause of death to us and to our people: for there was a great fear of death through all the town; the hand of God was very hard on them there.
<ASV> So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up with them, and she said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" (The ambush was sitting in an inner room.) But he snapped them from his arms like thread.
<ASV> And Saul said to him: Young man, of what family art thou? And David said: I am the son of thy servant Isai the Bethlehemite.
<ASV> and now, this  the thing which we do to Gibeah -- against it by lot!
<ASV> He chooseth new gods, Then war  at the gates! A shield is not seen -- and a spear Among forty thousand in Israel.
<ASV> and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we can't speak now in detail.
<ASV> And David said to him, Will you take me down to this band? And he said, If you give me your oath that you will not put me to death or give me up to my master, I will take you to them.
<ASV> although I could have confidence even in the flesh. If anyone else thinks to put confidence in the flesh, I can do so more:
<ASV> He was asked by him whence he came. And he answered: I am a Levite of Bethlehem Juda, and I am going to dwell where I can, and where I shall find a place to my advantage.
<ASV> And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel, and he sold him into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.
<ASV> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
<ASV> For the law, possessing a shadow of the good things that are about to come, not the form of things itself, is never able year by year by means of the same sacrifices which they offer without interruption to make perfect those who draw near.
<ASV> For you know that also afterwards, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, because he did not find an occasion for repentance, although he sought it with tears.
<ASV> By faith, concerning coming things, Isaac did bless Jacob and Esau;
<ASV> And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.
<ASV> Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambush, that they should make a thick column of smoke rise up out of the city.
<ASV> And Gedeon said to God: If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,
<ASV> And David took all the flocks and the herds,  they drove before the other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.
<ASV> whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God -- ever living to make intercession for them.
<ASV> circumcised on the eighth day, from the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born from Hebrews, according to the law a Pharisee,
<ASV> And the priest giveth to him the holy thing, for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence which is turned aside from the presence of Jehovah to put hot bread in the day of its being taken away.
<ASV> And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; ye must at any rate return him a trespass-offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
<ASV> The wadi torrent of Kishon swept them away, the raging wadi torrent, the wadi torrent of Kishon. March on, my soul, with strength!
<ASV> and they have asked of thee of welfare, and given to thee two loaves, and thou hast received from their hand.
<ASV> Then Saul said to his servant, "Well said. Come, let us go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.
<ASV> `When Jacob hath come in to Egypt, and your fathers cry unto Jehovah, then Jehovah sendeth Moses and Aaron, and they bring out your fathers from Egypt, and cause them to dwell in this place,
<ASV> So now the Lord God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?
<ASV> Now when it was evening they saw an old man coming back from his work in the fields; he was from the hill-country of Ephraim and was living in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.
<ASV> And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall do to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning thee, and shall appoint thee ruler over Israel,

<ASV> If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
<ASV> But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;
<ASV> She said, "Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.
<ASV> and like a robe you will roll them up, and like a garment they will be changed; but you are the same, and your years will not run out."
<ASV> And when they were come to the land of Suph, Saul said to the servant that was with him: Come, let us return, lest perhaps my father forget the asses, and be concerned for us.
<ASV> And he taketh his staff in his hand, and chooseth for him five smooth stones from the brook, and putteth them in the shepherds' habiliments that he hath, even in the scrip, and his sling  in his hand, and he draweth nigh unto the Philistine.
<ASV> The angel of Yahweh did not appear again to Manoah and his wife, and then Manoah knew that he was a messenger of Yahweh.
<ASV> For you had pity on those who were in prison, and had joy in the loss of your property, in the knowledge that you still had a better property and one which you would keep for ever.
<ASV> For it is God who is the cause of your desires and of your acts, for his good pleasure.
<ASV> And he sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and they also were gathered after him; and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
<ASV> And so then, do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of Yahweh, for the king of Israel has gone out to seek a single flea, as one hunts a partridge in the mountains."
<ASV> So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and they came to the torrent Besor; and those that were left stayed behind.
<ASV> And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and put out of their minds the Lord their God, and became servants to the Baals and the Astartes.
<ASV> And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering, and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.

<ASV> By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the going out of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
<ASV> Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.
<ASV> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
<ASV> And all the men of Israel were gathered to the city as one body united.
<ASV> and Jehovah calleth unto Samuel, and he saith, `Here  I.'
<ASV> Go and cry unto the gods on which ye have fixed; they -- they save you in the time of your adversity.'
<ASV> and the king sitteth on his seat, as time by time, on a seat by the wall, and Jonathan riseth, and Abner sitteth at the side of Saul, and David's place is looked after.
<ASV> And when I saw that ye would not save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah gave them into my hand. Why then are ye come up to me this day, to fight against me?
<ASV> And the people speak to him according to this word, saying, `Thus it is done to the man who smiteth him.'
<ASV> And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah gave them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
<ASV> Gaal spoke again and said, "Behold, people are coming down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim."
<ASV> And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
<ASV> And the day after the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of his house. And David played with his hand as at other times. And Saul held a spear in his hand,
<ASV> And the Lord said, Judah is to go up: see, I have given the land into his hands.
<ASV> And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.
<ASV> However the king of the children of Ammon didn't listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
<ASV> That I may have knowledge of him, and of the power of his coming back from the dead, and a part with him in his pains, becoming like him in his death;
<ASV> though he were Son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered;
<ASV> And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites,
<ASV> And the station of the Philistines goeth out unto the passage of Michmash.
<ASV> Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
<ASV> But early in the morning when Nabal had digested his wine, his wife told him these words, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
<ASV> Then Samuel said, "Bring Agag the king of Amalek out to me!" Agag came to him confidently, for Agag thought, "Surely the bitterness of death is over."
<ASV> And it shall be in the morning when the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and fall upon the city; and behold, he and the people that is with him shall come out against thee, and thou shalt do with him as thou shalt find occasion.
<ASV> And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.

<ASV> Blessings be on Jael, more than on all women! Blessings greater than on any in the tents!

<ASV> But of doing good and communicating [of your substance] be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
<ASV> And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
<ASV> And the young men of David come in, and speak unto Nabal according to all these words, in the name of David -- and rest.
<ASV> But his concubine felt repugnance toward him, and she left him and went to her father's house, to Bethlehem in Judah; she was there some four months.
<ASV> But the men would not give ear to him: so the man took his woman and sent her out to them; and they took her by force, using her for their pleasure all night till the morning; and when dawn came they let her go.
<ASV> So the five men going on came to Lais: and they saw how the people dwelt therein without any fear, according to the custom of the Sidonians, secure and easy, having no man at all to oppose them, being very rich, and living separated, at a distance from Sidon and from all men.
<ASV> But I will not say anything about my needs, for I am able, wherever I am, to be dependent on myself.
<ASV> And Jehovah addeth to call Samuel the third time, and he riseth and goeth unto Eli, and saith, `Here  I, for thou hast called for me;' and Eli understandeth that Jehovah is calling to the youth.
<ASV> Samuel said to Saul, "Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel. Now therefore listen to the voice of Yahweh's words.
<ASV> And Samuel said, What  then this bleating of sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of oxen which I hear?
<ASV> The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.

<ASV> By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
<ASV> And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
<ASV> the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,
<ASV> And the men did so, and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.
<ASV> David answered, "Behold the spear, O king! Then let one of the young men come over and get it.
<ASV> For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things  true, whatsoever things  noble, whatsoever things  just, whatsoever things  pure, whatsoever things  amiable, whatsoever things  of good report; if [there be] any virtue and if any praise, think on these things.
<ASV> And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
<ASV> Then the tribes of Israel sent men throughout all the tribes of Benjamin, saying, "What is this wickedness that happened among you?
<ASV> I will shoot three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark.
<ASV> They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; in the heavens will he thunder upon them. Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.

<ASV> "The vine said to them, 'Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?'
<ASV> And he answered them: I Because Israel took away my land when he came up out of Egypt, from the confines of the Arnon unto the Jaboc and the Jordan: now therefore restore the same peaceably to me.
<ASV> And gathering together an army, he defeated Amalec, and delivered Israel from the hand of them that spoiled them.
<ASV> And the men of Israel, that were beyond the valley, and beyond the Jordan, seeing that the Israelites were fled, and that Saul was dead, and his sons, forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came, and dwelt there.
<ASV> And he swore again to David. And David said: Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, and he will say: Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved. But truly as the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, there is but one step (as I may say) between me and death.
<ASV> Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God.
<ASV> And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
<ASV> Then Samuel, after hearing all the people had to say, went and gave an account of it to the Lord.
<ASV> He used to go on the circuit from year to year. He went around Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places.
<ASV> All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar off and embraced , and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.
<ASV> for, doubtless, of messengers it doth not lay hold, but of seed of Abraham it layeth hold,
<ASV> And David got up, and he and his men went and struck down two hundred men of the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they presented the full number to become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as his wife.
<ASV> And the Philistine draweth nigh, morning and evening, and stationeth himself forty days.
<ASV> And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?
<ASV> There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him to whom we must give an account.
<ASV> The servants of Saul told him, saying, "David spoke like this."
<ASV> for, Jehovah liveth, who is saving Israel: surely if it be in Jonathan my son, surely he doth certainly die;' and none is answering him out of all the people.
<ASV> Why did you not listen to the voice of Yahweh and fall with shouting on the plunder? You have done evil in the sight of Yahweh!"

<ASV> But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.

<ASV> And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.
<ASV> Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.

<ASV> and to those in Hormah, and to those in Chor-ashan, and to those in Athach,
<ASV> And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul: Behold a multitude cometh down from the mountains. And he answered him: Thou seest the shadows of the mountains as if they were the heads of men, and this is thy mistake.
<ASV> And he turned a little aside from him to another: and said the same word. And the people answered him as before.
<ASV> And Saul said to David, Here is my oldest daughter Merab, whom I will give you for your wife: only be strong for me, fighting in the Lord's wars. For Saul said, Let it not be through me that his fate comes to him, but through the Philistines.
<ASV> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
<ASV> So Saul returned from pursuing David, and went against the Philistines. Therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth.
<ASV> So the people sent to Shiloh and got the ark of the agreement of the Lord of armies whose resting-place is between the winged ones; and Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were there with the ark of God's agreement.
<ASV> And they said to him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for thee to be a priest for the house of one man, or to be priest for a tribe and a family in Israel?
<ASV> The children of Israel said, "Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn't come up in the assembly to Yahweh?" For they had made a great oath concerning him who didn't come up to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, "He shall surely be put to death."
<ASV> And the Israelites said to Yahweh, "We have sinned; do to us accordingly as you see fit; only please deliver us this day."
<ASV> For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline, think on these things.
<ASV> And they said to the men of Benjamin, Go into the vine-gardens, waiting there secretly,
<ASV> But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
<ASV> Count not thy handmaid for one of the daughters of Belial: for out of the abundance of my sorrow and grief have I spoken till now.
<ASV> and he stabbed it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot. The priest took all that the fork brought up for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
<ASV> And thou shalt see thy rival in the temple, in all the prosperity of Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.
<ASV> When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got off of her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.
<ASV> And the people come in to Beth-El, and sit there till the evening before God, and lift up their voice, and weep -- a great weeping,
<ASV> Now the children of Israel had given a sign to them, whom they had laid in ambushes, that after they had taken the city, they should make a fire: that by the smoke rising on high, they might shew that the city was taken.
<ASV> For we do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but who has been tempted in all things in the same way, without sin.
<ASV> And Samuel taketh a stone, and setteth  between Mizpeh and Shen, and calleth its name Eben-Ezer, saying, `Hitherto hath Jehovah helped us.'

<ASV> And when they got up early on the morning after, Dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord; and his head and his hands were broken off on the doorstep; only the base was in its place.

<ASV> And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.
<ASV> And Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel: and two thousand were with Saul in Machmas, and in mount Bethel: and a thousand with Jonathan in Gabaa of Benjamin, and the rest of the people he sent back every man to their dwellings.
<ASV> And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the head of his spear weighed six hundred sicles of iron: and his armourbearer went before him.
<ASV> Saul was told that David had come to Keilah. Saul said, "God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in by entering into a town that has gates and bars."

<ASV> And they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech got the support of a number of uncontrolled and good-for-nothing persons.
<ASV> Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The Lord hath not chosen these.
<ASV> Then the troops took the plunder: they took sheep and cattle and calves and slaughtered them on the ground and the troops ate them all with the blood.
<ASV> Is not this David, to whom they sung in their dances, saying: Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
<ASV> being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that  through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
<ASV> Then Jonathan said to David, "Yahweh the God of Israel is my witness that I will question my father by this time the day after tomorrow. And look, if he is well disposed toward you, will I not send word to you and disclose it to you?
<ASV> And if to live in the flesh  to me a fruit of work, then what shall I choose? I know not;
<ASV> And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, How is it that thou askest after my name, seeing it is wonderful?
<ASV> And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can stretch forth his hand against Jehovah's anointed, and be guiltless?
<ASV> He scraped it out into his hands, and he went on, eating it as he went. And he went to his father and mother and gave some to them, and they ate it. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the body of the lion.
<ASV> and also all that generation have been gathered unto their fathers, and another generation riseth after them who have not known Jehovah, and even the work which He hath done to Israel.
<ASV> And he sent to Abimelech at Arumah, saying, See, Gaal, the son of Ebed, and his brothers have come to Shechem, and they are working up the town against you.
<ASV> and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.
<ASV> And David riseth, and passeth over, he and six hundred men who  with him, unto Achish son of Maoch king of Gath;
<ASV> Samuel arose, and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.
<ASV> And though by this time it would be right for you to be teachers, you still have need of someone to give you teaching about the first simple rules of God's revelation; you have become like babies who have need of milk, and not of solid food.

<ASV> He will take one tenth of your flocks; and you will be his servants.
<ASV> And he sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying: Suffer me to pass through thy land. But he would not condescend to his request. He sent also to the king of Moab, who likewise refused to give him passage. He abode therefore in Cades,
<ASV> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel to Ramah.
<ASV> And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not. Thou hast propounded the riddle to the children of my people, and hast not explained it to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not explained it to my father nor my mother, and shall I explain it to thee?
<ASV> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:
<ASV> And Samuel saith unto the people, `Jehovah -- He who made Moses and Aaron, and who brought up your fathers out of the land of Egypt!
<ASV> and it hath been, when their fathers or their brethren come in to plead unto us, that we have said unto them, Favour us  them, for we have not taken  each his wife in battle, for ye -- ye have not given to them at this time  ye are guilty.'
<ASV> Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
<ASV> So the Philistines were overcome, and did not come into the country of Israel again: and all the days of Samuel the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines.
<ASV> And others experienced mocking and flogging, and in addition bonds and imprisonment.
<ASV> If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us."
<ASV> Do not go away till I come with my offering and put it before you. And he said, I will not go away before you come back.
<ASV> Why do you despise my sacrifice and my offering which I commanded for my dwelling place, while you honored your sons more than me by making yourselves fat from the best of all the offerings of my people Israel?
<ASV> But David said: You shall not do so, my brethren, with these things, which the Lord hath given us, who hath kept us, and hath delivered the robbers that invaded us into our hands.
<ASV> So David struck the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive; he took the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned and came to Achish.
<ASV> But to stay on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand.
<ASV> He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.
<ASV> And she sendeth and calleth for Barak son of Abinoam, out of Kedesh-Naphtali, and saith unto him, `Hath not Jehovah, God of Israel, commanded? go, and thou hast drawn towards mount Tabor, and hast taken with thee ten thousand men, out of the sons of Naphtali, and out of the sons of Zebulun,
<ASV> And the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
<ASV> Then Jesse said to his son David, "Please take for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and bring them quickly to the camp for your brothers.
<ASV> And David sweareth to Saul, and Saul goeth unto his house, and David and his men have gone up unto the fortress.
<ASV> and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up; for to-morrow I will give them into thy hand.
<ASV> So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.
<ASV> For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense;
<ASV> and that I may be found in him, not having my righteousness, which [would be] on the principle of law, but that which is by faith of Christ, the righteousness which  of God through faith,
<ASV> When these went into Micah's house, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"
<ASV> Gilead lived beyond the Jordan. Why did Dan remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and lived by his creeks.
<ASV> In these days hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world.
<ASV> Anna answering, said: Not so, my lord: for I am an exceeding unhappy woman, and have drunk neither wine nor any strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the Lord.
<ASV> And you shall cry out in that day from the face of the king, whom you have chosen to yourselves. and the Lord will not hear you in that day, because you desired unto yourselves a king.
<ASV> and him who was made some little less than messengers we see -- Jesus -- because of the suffering of the death, with glory and honour having been crowned, that by the grace of God for every one he might taste of death.
<ASV> And the servants of Saul told him, saying: Such words as these hath David spoken.
<ASV> And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:

<ASV> And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the Lord in eating with the blood.

<ASV> For the earth that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled, receiveth blessing from God.

<ASV> But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak thus.
<ASV> but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the citizens of Shechem and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the citizens of Shechem and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.

<ASV> And Othniel son of Kenaz, younger brother of Caleb, doth capture it, and he giveth to him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
<ASV> And embraced the man. And the son in law tarried in the house of his father in law three days, eating with him and drinking familiarly.
<ASV> And Samuel said to him: The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to thy neighbour who is better than thee.

<ASV> And Micah said to him, "Stay with me and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give to you ten pieces of silver a year, a set of clothes, and your food." So the Levite went with him.

<ASV> And Samuel said, Why do you put your questions to me, seeing that God has gone away from you and is on the side of him who is against you?
<ASV> And the descendants of Benjamin thought, "They are being defeated before us as previously," and the Israelites said, "Let us flee and lure them away from the city to the main roads."
<ASV> of the hospitality be not forgetful, for through this unawares certain did entertain messengers;
<ASV> Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time.
<ASV> A son of a year  Saul in his reigning, yea, two years he hath reigned over Israel,
<ASV> And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
<ASV> And: Thou in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth: and the works of thy hands are the heavens.

<ASV> All the most valiant men arose, and walked all the night, and took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, from the wall of Bethsan: and they came to Jabes Galaad, and burnt them there:
<ASV> Why hast thou abode between the boundaries, To hear lowings of herds? For the divisions of Reuben, Great  the searchings of heart!
<ASV> And the Philistine said: I have defied the bands of Israel this day: Give me a man, and let him fight with me hand to hand.
<ASV> So Samuel made prayer to the Lord; and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people were in fear of the Lord and of Samuel.
<ASV> Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.

<ASV> But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
<ASV> Because this  the covenant that I will covenant to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: Giving my laws into their mind, I will write them also upon their hearts; and I will be to them for God, and *they* shall be to me for people.
<ASV> because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will remember no more;' --
<ASV> And Samuel said to the people: It is the Lord, who made Moses and Aaron, and brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt.
<ASV> Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like to  brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people;

<ASV> Women had their dead given back to them living; others let themselves be cruelly attacked, having no desire to go free, so that they might have a better life to come;
<ASV> For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
<ASV> For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
<ASV> For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.

<ASV> Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.
<ASV> And they said to him, "Keep quiet! Put your hand on your mouth and come with us and be for us a father and a priest. Is it better being a priest for a house of one man or being a priest for a tribe and clan in Israel?"
<ASV> And it cometh to pass, when David completeth to speak these words unto Saul, that Saul saith, `Is this thy voice, my son David?' and Saul lifteth up his voice, and weepeth.

<ASV> And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you put to death in the valley of Elah, is here folded in a cloth at the back of the ephod: take that, if you will, for there is no other sword here. And David said, there is no other sword like that; give it to me.
<ASV> The Lord do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the Lord be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
<ASV> And it came to pass, that from the day the ark of the Lord abode in Cariathiarim days were multiplied, (for it was now the twentieth year,) and all the house of Israel rested following the Lord.
<ASV> And Saul sendeth messengers to take David, and she saith, `He  sick.'
<ASV> so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ;
<ASV> May the Lord be judge between me and you, and may the Lord give me my rights against you, but my hand will never be lifted up against you.
<ASV> And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
<ASV> And all the citizens of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the memorial-oak that is in Shechem.
<ASV> And Manue said to the angel of the Lord: I beseech thee to consent to my request, and let us dress a kid for thee.
<ASV> So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
<ASV> Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
<ASV> And he numbered them in Bezec: and there were of the children of Israel three hundred thousand: and of the men of Juda thirty thousand.

<ASV> They are making their heart glad, and lo, men of the city, men -- sons of worthlessness -- have gone round about the house, beating on the door, and they speak unto the old man, the master of the house, saying, `Bring out the man who hath come unto thine house, and we know him.'
<ASV> And he went away from the town of Beth-lehem-judah, looking for somewhere to make his living-place; and on his journey he came to the hill-country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah.
<ASV> And Saul saith unto Jonathan, `Declare to me, what hast thou done?' and Jonathan declareth to him, and saith, `I certainly tasted with the end of the rod that  in my hand a little honey; lo, I die!'
<ASV> Then Jesse sent for Abinadab and made him come before Samuel. And he said, The Lord has not taken this one.
<ASV> Wherefore let us, receiving a kingdom not to be shaken, have grace, by which let us serve God acceptably with reverence and fear.
<ASV> And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites the children of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
<ASV> And he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen! And the fear of Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man.
<ASV> And David saith unto Jonathan, `Who doth declare to me? or what  thy father doth answer thee sharply?'
<ASV> And all that were in distress and oppressed with debt, and under affliction of mind gathered themselves unto him: and he became their prince, and there were with him about four hundred men.
<ASV> Then David said, "O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
<ASV> So Samuel took a single stone and put it between Mizpah and Shen, and he named it Ebenezer and said, "Up to here Yahweh has helped us."
<ASV> And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy men that are weary?
<ASV> saying, `Blessing indeed I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;'
<ASV> For which cause God also hath exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above all names:
<ASV> And the people felt sorry for Benjamin because Yahweh weakened the tribes of Israel.
<ASV> The lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, "Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand."
<ASV> but to Hannah he used to give a double portion, for he loved Hannah; but Jehovah had shut up her womb.
<ASV> And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He giveth them into the hand of spoilers, and they spoil them, and He selleth them into the hand of their enemies round about, and they have not been able any more to stand before their enemies;

<ASV> Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to Yahweh. Samuel cried to Yahweh for Israel; and Yahweh answered him.

<ASV> Grace be with you all. Amen.

<ASV> if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house today, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you;
<ASV> And the men of Israel and of Judah got up, and gave a cry, and went after the Philistines as far as Gath and the town doors of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines were falling down by the road from Shaaraim all the way to Gath and Ekron.
<ASV> And David speaketh unto the men who are standing by him, saying, `What is done to the man who smiteth this Philistine, and hath turned aside reproach from Israel? for who  this uncircumcised Philistine that he hath reproached the ranks of the living God?'
<ASV> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.

<ASV> And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it kill us not, and our people. For there was deadly alarm throughout the city: the hand of God was very heavy there;
<ASV> And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him, and said to him, Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Samuel, How long will you go on sorrowing for Saul, seeing that I have put him from his place as king over Israel? Take oil in your vessel and go; I will send you to Jesse, the Beth-lehemite: for I have got a king for myself among his sons.
<ASV> Obey your prelates, and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an account of your souls; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief. For this is not expedient for you.
<ASV> So David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.

<ASV> Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.

<ASV> Now give orders to your servants who are here before you to go in search of a man who is an expert player on a corded instrument: and it will be that when the evil spirit from God is on you, he will make music for you on his instrument, and you will get well.
<ASV> But the boy did not know anything about this; only Jonathan and David knew the matter.

<ASV> and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn't save with sword and spear; for the battle is Yahweh's, and he will give you into our hand."
<ASV> Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.
<ASV> For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.
<ASV> Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul and an evil spirit from Yahweh tormented him.
<ASV> And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

<ASV> David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to stay at the brook Besor; and they went out to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. When David came near to the people, he greeted them.
<ASV> And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
<ASV> At Bezek they came upon Adoni-bezek, and they fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.

<ASV> But, my dearly beloved, we trust better things of you, and nearer to salvation; though we speak thus.
<ASV> Then Samuel said to Saul, "You have behaved foolishly! You have not kept the command of Yahweh your God which he commanded you. For then, Yahweh would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.

<ASV> When they came down from the high place to the town, he spoke with Saul on the roof.
<ASV> And he said to Jether his eldest son: Arise, and slay them. But he drew not his sword: for he was afraid, being but yet a boy.
<ASV> but he with an oath by the one who said to him, "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever'"),

<ASV> So all the men of Israel were banded together against the town, united like one man.
<ASV> So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated and each man fled to his tent, for the slaughter was very great. Thirty thousand foot soldiers from Israel fell.
<ASV> Fleeing as far as Bethsetta, and the border of Abelmahula in Tebbath. But the men of Israel shouting from Nephtali and Aser, and from all Manasses pursued after Madian.

<ASV> Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.

<ASV> And he answered them: I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon: and I called you to assist me, and you would not do it.
<ASV> Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, "What ails the people that they weep?" They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.

<ASV> and not frightened in anything by the opposers, which is to them a demonstration of destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God;
<ASV> As he says in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
<ASV> They put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Yahweh; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
<ASV> Now faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not.
<ASV> Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
<ASV> As soon as ye come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people eat not until he has come, because he blesses the sacrifice; afterwards they eat that are invited. And now go up; for this very day shall ye find him.

<ASV> And the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burned her and her father with fire.
<ASV> (In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, "Come, and let us go to the seer"; for he who is now called a prophet was before called a seer.)
<ASV> even though the men were very good to us; we were not mistreated and did not miss anything all the days we went about with them while we were in the field.
<ASV> When they were coming back after David had returned from striking down the Philistine, the women went out from all the cities of Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul with tambourines, with joy, and with three-stringed instruments.

<ASV> And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
<ASV> As they cried to the children of Dan, they turned their faces, and said to Micah, "What ails you, that you come with such a company?"
<ASV> And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
<ASV> and said, Let me go, I pray thee; for we have a family sacrifice in the city; and my brother himself has commanded me [to be there]; and now, if I have found favour in thy sight, let me go away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. He has therefore not come to the king's table.
<ASV> He also says, "Their sins and their lawless deeds I will never remember again."

<ASV> This day, and the Lord will deliver thee into my hand, and I will slay thee, and take away thy head from thee: and I will give the carcasses of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth: that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
<ASV> Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I shall see how it goes with me:
<ASV> And Saul said, Come near, all you chiefs of the people, and let us get word from God and see in whom is this sin today.
<ASV> And Saul sent for the people and had them numbered in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.
<ASV> David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
<ASV> complete my joy, so that you are in agreement, having the same love, united in spirit, having one purpose.
<ASV> For unto Thessalonica also you sent once and again for my use.
<ASV> Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath
<ASV> Now when Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, "Whose son is this young man, Abner?" And Abner said, "As your soul lives, O king, I do not know."
<ASV> And the man riseth to go, he and his concubine, and his young man, and his father-in-law, father of the young woman, saith to him, `Lo, I pray thee, the day hath fallen toward evening, lodge all night, I pray thee; lo, the declining of the day! lodge here, and let thine heart be glad -- and ye have risen early to-morrow for your journey, and thou hast gone to thy tent.'
<ASV> And Samson saith, `With a jaw-bone of the ass -- an ass upon asses -- with a jaw-bone of the ass I have smitten a thousand men.'
<ASV> And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

<ASV> And they said to him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may give thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me that ye will not fall on me yourselves.

<ASV> Manasseh did not drive out Beth-Sean and its towns, or Taanach and its towns, or the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; the Canaanites were determined to live in this land.

<ASV> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim:
<ASV> And David in answer said to the priest, Certainly women have been kept from us; and as has been done before when I have gone out the arms of the young men were made holy, even though it was a common journey; how much more today will their arms be made holy.
<ASV> Therefore also God exalted him and graciously granted him the name above every name,
<ASV> And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took his charge and went, as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the wagon-defence; and the host which was going forth to the battle-array shouted for the fight.
<ASV> don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
<ASV> And build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.

<ASV> Now Yahweh's Spirit departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.
<ASV> Saul took him on that very day and did not allow him to return to his father's house.
<ASV> make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;
<ASV> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holies, every year with the blood of others:
<ASV> And they sent word to David, saying, The Philistines are fighting against Keilah and taking the grain from the grain-floors.
<ASV> Your flocks also he will tithe, and you shall be his servants.
<ASV> And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

<ASV> These indeed out of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the glad tidings;
<ASV> Saul said, "Hear now, you son of Ahitub." He answered, "Here I am, my lord."
<ASV> Grace be with all of you.

<ASV> And he restored the eleven hundred silver-pieces to his mother; and his mother said, I had dedicated the silver to Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image; and now I will restore it to thee.

<ASV> We have an altar from which those priests who are servants in the Tent may not take food.
<ASV> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and showed respect.
<ASV> For a land, drinking in the frequent rain and producing good plants for those for whom it is worked, has a blessing from God:
<ASV> And why will ye harden your heart, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? When he had wrought mightily among them, did they not let them go, and they departed?
<ASV> And the kine went straight forward on the way to Beth-shemesh; they went by the one high way, lowing as they went; and they turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.
<ASV> And they rose in the morning, and worshipped before the Lord: and they returned, and came into their house at Ramatha. And Elcana knew Anna his wife: and the Lord remembered her.

<ASV> being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which  by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise.
<ASV> The servant answered Saul again, and said, "Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way."
<ASV> and Jonathan son of Saul delighted exceedingly in David, and Jonathan declareth to David, saying, `Saul my father is seeking to put thee to death, and, now, take heed, I pray thee, in the morning, and thou hast abode in a secret place, and been hidden,
<ASV> For the Amorites would go on living in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; but the children of Joseph became stronger than they, and put them to forced work.
<ASV> and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel."
<ASV> Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
<ASV> Then David got up afterward and went out of the cave and called after Saul, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked after him, David knelt down with his face to the ground and bowed down.
<ASV> And Jonathan spoke good things of David to Saul his father: and said to him: Sin not, O king, against thy servant, David, because he hath not sinned against thee, and his works are very good towards thee.
<ASV> Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.
<ASV> And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
<ASV> And Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were nowhere, we went to Samuel.
<ASV> And Saul said: I will give her to him, that she may be a stumblingblock to him, and that the band of the Philistines may be upon him. And Saul said to David: In two things thou shalt be my son in law this day.
<ASV> And David said to Abishai Do not put him to death; for who, without sin, may put out his hand against the man on whom the Lord has put the holy oil?

<ASV> And the sons of Dan send, out of their family, five men of them, men, sons of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to traverse the land, and to search it, and they say unto them, `Go, search the land;' and they come into the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodge there.
<ASV> But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words.
<ASV> And Saul made an oath to her by the Lord, saying, By the living Lord, no punishment will come to you for this.
<ASV> how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship  living God?
<ASV> And because the children are flesh and blood, he took a body himself and became like them; so that by his death he might put an end to him who had the power of death, that is to say, the Evil One;
<ASV> peace pursue with all, and the separation, apart from which no one shall see the Lord,
<ASV> And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.
<ASV> And all Israel had the news that Saul had made an attack on the Philistines, and that Israel was bitterly hated by the Philistines. And the people came together after Saul to Gilgal.
<ASV> for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;
<ASV> By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.
<ASV> And Samuel arose and went up from Galgal to Gabaa of Benjamin. And the rest of the people went up after Saul, to meet the people who fought against them, going from Galgal to Gabaa in the hill of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people, that were found with him, about six hundred men.
<ASV> And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered -- to the end, did sit down on the right hand of God, --
<ASV> And Dalila said to Samson: Tell me, I beseech thee, wherein thy greatest strength lieth, and what it is wherewith if thou wert bound thou couldst not break loose.
<ASV> Then one of the servants in answer said, I have seen a son of Jesse, the Beth-lehemite, who is expert at playing, and a strong man and a man of war; and he is wise in his words, and pleasing in looks, and the Lord is with him.
<ASV> and Jehovah doth turn back to each his righteousness and his faithfulness, in that Jehovah hath given thee to-day into  hand, and I have not been willing to put forth my hand against the anointed of Jehovah,
<ASV> And they smite Moab at that time, about ten thousand men, all robust, and every one a man of valour, and not a man hath escaped,
<ASV> Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
<ASV> And it came to pass on the day that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions;
<ASV> And David saith, `Jehovah, who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, He doth deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.' And Saul saith unto David, `Go, and Jehovah is with thee.'
<ASV> And when the people of Ashdod got up early on the morning after, they saw that Dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon up and put him in his place again.
<ASV> because also in Thessalonica, both once and again to my need ye sent;
<ASV> Now his father and mother had no knowledge that this was the purpose of the Lord, who had the destruction of the Philistines in mind. Now the Philistines at that time were ruling over Israel.
<ASV> Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.
<ASV> And it cometh to pass, after a time, that the Bene-Ammon fight with Israel,
<ASV> I also will no longer drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died from before them;
<ASV> And the young man addeth to answer Saul, and saith, `Lo, there is found with me a fourth of a shekel of silver: and I have given to the man of God, and he hath declared to us our way.'
<ASV> Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances. She was his only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
<ASV> and Saul saith unto him, `Whose son  thou, O youth?' and David saith, `Son of thy servant Jesse, the Beth-Lehemite.'
<ASV> And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
<ASV> I will go out and stand at my father's side in the field where you are, and I will speak about you to my father; if I find out anything I will tell it to you."
<ASV> So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel on that day.
<ASV> Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:
<ASV> And the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, and they said: What is this noise of a great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp.
<ASV> To morrow about this same hour I will send thee a man of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be ruler over my people Israel: and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked down upon my people, because their cry is come to me.
<ASV> Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up to Beth-el, weeping and waiting there before the Lord, going without food all day till evening, and offering burned offerings and peace-offerings before the Lord.
<ASV> And I will raise me up a faithful priest, who shall do according to my heart, and my soul, and I will build him a faithful house, and he shall walk all days before my anointed.
<ASV> Now therefore hearken to their voice: but yet testify to them, and foretell them the right of the king, that shall reign over them.
<ASV> and, now, station yourselves, and I judge you before Jehovah, with all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which He did with you, and with your fathers.
<ASV> For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, who had brought many children into glory, to perfect the author of their salvation, by his passion.
<ASV> But Samson said to them: Although you have done this, yet will I be revenged of you, and then I will be quiet.
<ASV> And inside the second veil was the place which is named the Holy of holies;
<ASV> For by this, the elders obtained testimony.
<ASV> We have an altar from which those who serve in the tabernacle do not have the right to eat.
<ASV> The children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
<ASV> And if the man said to him, "Let them burn the fat completely first, then take for yourself as you desire," then he would say to him, "No! Give it now! If not, I will take it by force!"
<ASV> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
<ASV> Behold, today your eyes have seen how Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave. Some urged me to kill you; but I spared you; and I said, I will not stretch out my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh's anointed.
<ASV> And it came to pass after some time, that the children of Ammon fought with Israel.
<ASV> And David answered Jonathan: Who shall bring me word, if thy father should answer thee harshly concerning me?
<ASV> And after the second curtain was a tent called the holy of holies,

<ASV> only, fear ye Jehovah, and ye have served Him in truth with all your heart, for see that which He hath made great with you;

<ASV> Even before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he will not accept sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

<ASV> And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.
<ASV> The weight of the gold ear-rings which he got from them was one thousand, seven hundred shekels of gold; in addition to the moon-ornaments and jewels and the purple robes which were on the kings of Midian, and the chains on their camels' necks.

<ASV> And the watchers, rushing on Gibeah and overrunning it, put all the town to the sword without mercy.
<ASV> David therefore departed from there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him.
<ASV> And Jonathan said, Do not have such a thought: for if I saw that my father was designing evil against you, would I not give you word of it?
<ASV> He came to the sheep pens beside the road, and a cave was there. Then Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost part of the cave.
<ASV> And Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, and his anger was kindled;
<ASV> And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
<ASV> So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.
<ASV> And Jonathan said to David: Go in peace: and let all stand that we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying: The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.

<ASV> For the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people.
<ASV> And Samuel said to all the people, Do you see the man of the Lord's selection, how there is no other like him among all the people? And all the people with loud cries said, Long life to the king!
<ASV> The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh's sight, and served the Baals.
<ASV> My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless Jehovah!
<ASV> They abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; and they provoked Yahweh to anger.
<ASV> Therefore, my dearly beloved brethren, and most desired, my joy and my crown; so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.
<ASV> And Samuel said: What meaneth then this bleating of the flocks, which soundeth in my ears, and the lowing of the herds, which I hear?
<ASV> and they bury him in the border of his inheritance, in Timnath-Heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of mount Gaash;
<ASV> And Midian was stronger than Israel; and because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made holes for themselves in the mountains, and hollows in the rocks, and strong places.

<ASV> but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.
<ASV> (In the past in Israel, when a man went to get directions from God, he said, Come let us go to the Seer, for he who now is named Prophet was in those days given the name of Seer.)
<ASV> And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
<ASV> And David said to the Philistine: Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, which thou hast defied.
<ASV> So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
<ASV> When the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, "What is the noise of this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?" Then they learned that the ark of Yahweh had come into the camp.
<ASV> Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
<ASV> O Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, and passedst by the regions of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped water.
<ASV> When you come into the town you will see him straight away, before he goes up to the high place for the feast: the people are waiting for his blessing before starting the feast, and after that the guests will take part in it. So go up now and you will see him.
<ASV> and the peace of God, which surpasses every understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts by Christ Jesus.
<ASV> A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech's head, and broke his skull.
<ASV> With such force that the haft went in after the blade into the wound, and was closed up with the abundance of fat. So that he did not draw out the dagger, but left it in his body as he had struck it in. And forthwith by the secret parts of nature the excrements of the belly came out.
<ASV> concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead.
<ASV> And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art: and I will speak of thee to my father, and whatsoever I shall see, I will tell thee.
<ASV> And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, twenty cities, even unto Abel-Cheramim, with a very great slaughter; and the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
<ASV> A bronze helmet was on his head, and he was clothed with scale body armor; the weight of the body armor was five thousand bronze shekels.
<ASV> Now the sons of Eli were wicked men. They didn't know Yahweh.
<ASV> Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
<ASV> But the chiefs of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna even now in your hand that we are to give bread to your army?

<ASV> To him succeeded Ahialon a Zabulonite: and he judged Israel ten years:
<ASV> And David said, Jehovah who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and Jehovah be with thee.
<ASV> So they ran and took him from there, and when he took his stand among the people, he was taller than all the people from his shoulders and up.
<ASV> Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed. Every one of them could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
<ASV> Now when Samuel heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of Yahweh.
<ASV> And Midian is humbled before the sons of Israel, and have not added to lift up their head; and the land resteth forty years in the days of Gideon.
<ASV> Women received by a rising again their dead, and others were tortured, not accepting the redemption, that a better rising again they might receive,
<ASV> Then the children of Benjamin came out from Gibeah, cutting down twenty-two thousand of the Israelites that day.
<ASV> Now of the things we are saying this is the chief point: We have such a high priest, who has taken his place at the right hand of God's high seat of glory in heaven,
<ASV> Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, let us go to Gilgal, and let us renew the kingship there."
<ASV> And the fight was going badly for Saul, and the archers came across him, and he was wounded by the archers.
<ASV> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Rise and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength." Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels' necks.
<ASV> For if a man at any time shall rise, and persecute thee, and seek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be kept, as in the bundle of the living, with the Lord thy God: but the souls of thy enemies shall be whirled, as with the violence and whirling of a sling.
<ASV> I have a maiden daughter, and this man hath a concubine, I will bring them out to you, and you may humble them, and satisfy your lust: only, I beseech you, commit not this crime against nature on the man.
<ASV> Samuel said to Saul, "You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you; for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel forever.
<ASV> And he said to his boy: Go, and fetch me the arrows which I shoot. And when the boy ran, he shot another arrow beyond the boy.
<ASV> Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
<ASV> And Jerubbaal son of Joash goeth and dwelleth in his own house,
<ASV> which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil,
<ASV> Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
<ASV> So with these words David kept his servants back, and did not let them make an attack on Saul. And Saul got up and went on his way.
<ASV> "But they forgot Yahweh their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.
<ASV> Kings came,—they fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan; At Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; They took no spoil of silver.
<ASV> Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
<ASV> There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city, and lived in it.
<ASV> And his wife answered him: If the Lord had a mind to kill us, he would not have received a holocaust and libations at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor have told us the things that are to come.
<ASV> and afterwards have the sons of Judah gone down to fight against the Canaanite, inhabiting the hill-country, and the south, and the low country;
<ASV> They said to him, "Look, you are old and your sons do not follow in your ways. So then appoint a king for us to judge us, like all the nations.
<ASV> And the house of Joseph sent to search out Bethel; now the name of the city before was Luz.
<ASV> And we also will be like all nations: and our king shall judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles for us.
<ASV> and David asketh at Jehovah, saying, `I pursue after this troop -- do I overtake it?' And He saith to him, `Pursue, for thou dost certainly overtake, and dost certainly deliver.'
<ASV> She said, "Surely I will go with you; however, there will be no glory for you in the path you are taking, for Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." And Deborah stood up and went with Barak to Kedesh.
<ASV> Now when Saul came back from fighting the Philistines, news was given him that David was in the waste land of En-gedi.
<ASV> The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
<ASV> She sent and called for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh Naphtali and said to him, "Has not Yahweh the God of Israel commanded you? 'Go, march to Mount Tabor, and take ten thousand men from the descendants of Naphtali and Zebulun.
<ASV> And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.
<ASV> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<ASV> And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou didst not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines were assembled at Michmash,

<ASV> And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.

<ASV> and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, Samuel was lying in the temple of Yahweh where the ark of God was.
<ASV> Then he said to her, Give me now a little water, for I have need of a drink. And opening a skin of milk, she gave him drink, and put the cover over him again.
<ASV> And David's men say unto him, `Lo, we here in Judah are afraid; and how much more when we go to Keilah, unto the ranks of the Philistines?'
<ASV> He struck of the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into Yahweh's ark, he struck fifty thousand seventy of the men. Then the people mourned, because Yahweh had struck the people with a great slaughter.
<ASV> Not that I speak as regards privation, for as to me *I* have learnt in those circumstances in which I am, to be satisfied in myself.
<ASV> the Holy Spirit shewing this, that the way of the [holy of] holies has not yet been made manifest while as yet the first tabernacle has  standing;
<ASV> Then said Saul to his armour-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through with it; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armour-bearer would not; for he was much afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell on it.
<ASV> And Saul and his men went to seek . And they told David; and he came down from the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And Saul heard , and he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
<ASV> And all the Israelites that had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, hearing that the Philistines fled, joined themselves with their countrymen in the fight. And there were with Saul about ten thousand men.
<ASV> And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued after them, and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the camp.
<ASV> On the next day, the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
<ASV> Then the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
<ASV> The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh's sight, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.
<ASV> And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, "What is your name so that when your words come true we may honor you?"
<ASV> and I say, Now do the Philistines come down unto me to Gilgal, and the face of Jehovah I have not appeased; and I force myself, and cause the burnt-offering to ascend.'
<ASV> The king of the children of Ammon, however, did not give ear to the words which Jephthah sent to him.
<ASV> And his father and his mother have not known that from Jehovah it , that a meeting he is seeking of the Philistines; and at that time the Philistines are ruling over Israel.
<ASV> And David's men said to him, "Look, today is the day about which Yahweh said to you, 'See, I am giving your enemy into your hand, and you can do to him whatever seems good to you.'" So David got up and secretly cut the hem of Saul's robe.
<ASV> And Gedeon the son of Joas died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father in Ephra of the family of Ezri.
<ASV> Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. David said, "Does it seems to you a light thing to be the king's son-in-law, since I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?"
<ASV> And answering Saul, Jonathan said, He made a request to me that he might go to Beth-lehem,
<ASV> And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.
<ASV> And as Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah answered him, Behold the man of whom I spoke to thee! this man shall rule over my people.
<ASV> And a spirit of sadness  Jehovah is unto Saul, and he is sitting in his house, and his javelin in his hand, and David is playing with the hand,
<ASV> For on the one hand a preceding commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness
<ASV> For he does not indeed take hold of angels [by the hand], but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham.
<ASV> for I have no one like-minded, who sincerely for the things concerning you will care,
<ASV> And this man went up out of his city upon the appointed days, to adore and to offer sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo. And the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were there priests of the Lord.
<ASV> And that were in Hebron, and to the rest that were in those places, in which David had abode with his men.
<ASV> Let us go in with true hearts, in certain faith, having our hearts made free from the sense of sin and our bodies washed with clean water:
<ASV> And his concubine, that he had in Sichem, bore him a son, whose name was Abimelech.
<ASV> Then the children of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served Yahweh only.
<ASV> And Saul said to them, "May you be blessed by Yahweh, for you have shown me compassion!
<ASV> And Samuel took a young lamb, offering all of it as a burned offering to the Lord; and Samuel made prayers to the Lord for Israel and the Lord gave him an answer.
<ASV> Then Samuel took the bottle of oil, and put the oil on him there among his brothers: and from that day the spirit of the Lord came on David with power. So Samuel went back to Ramah.
<ASV> For in one place he has said of the seventh day, And God had rest from all his works on the seventh day;
<ASV> Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good conscience, in all things willing to behave well,
<ASV> how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation which had its beginning when it was spoken through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard,
<ASV> And Samson turneth aside  the two middle pillars, on which the house is established, and on which it is supported,  the one with his right hand, and one with his left;
<ASV> Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, `Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not will, and a body Thou didst prepare for me,
<ASV> The things which came to you by my teaching and preaching, and which you saw in me, these things do, and the God of peace will be with you.
<ASV> His legs were covered with plates of brass and hanging on his back was a javelin of brass.
<ASV> And again, "I will trust in him." And again, "Behold, I and the children God has given me."
<ASV> And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
<ASV> Then the king said, "You inquire whose son this young man is."
<ASV> Nephtali also destroyed not the inhabitants of Bethsames, and of Bethanath: and he dwelt in the midst of the Chanaanites the inhabitants of the land, and the Bethsamites and Bethanites were tributaries to him.
<ASV> Samuel said, "Why then do you ask me, since Yahweh has departed from you and has become your adversary?
<ASV> And let her eat nothing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: and whatsoever I have commanded her, let her fulfill and observe.
<ASV> Then Saul took three thousand of the best men out of all Israel, and went in search of David and his men on the rocks of the mountain goats.
<ASV> and ye have known, even ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news when I went forth from Macedonia, no assembly did communicate with me in regard to giving and receiving except ye only;
<ASV> And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.
<ASV> On the next day, an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saul, and he prophesied in the middle of the house. David played with his hand, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand;
<ASV> And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart exulteth in Jehovah, my horn is lifted up in Jehovah; my mouth is opened wide over mine enemies; for I rejoice in thy salvation.
<ASV> And they say, `What  the guilt-offering which we send back to Him?' and they say, `The number of the princes of the Philistines -- five golden emerods, and five golden mice -- for one plague  to you all, and to your princes,
<ASV> And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
<ASV> For I have no man of like mind who will truly have care for you.
<ASV> And when he arrived he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down from the hill country with him leading them.
<ASV> Let our lord now command your servants who are in front of you to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. Then when the evil spirit from God is on you, he will play with his hand, and you will be well."
<ASV> And she said, I will certainly go with you: though you will get no honour in your undertaking, for the Lord will give Sisera into the hands of a woman. So Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.
<ASV> And the youth Samuel is serving Jehovah before Eli, and the word of Jehovah hath been precious in those days -- there is no vision broken forth.
<ASV> Be obedient to those leading you, and be subject, for these do watch for your souls, as about to give account, that with joy they may do this, and not sighing, for this  unprofitable to you.
<ASV> But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
<ASV> Then the rulers of the Philistines went out to war: and whenever they went out, David did more wisely than all the other servants of Saul, so that his name became greatly honoured.
<ASV> and Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool upper room. And Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you." So he got up from his seat.
<ASV> And there went out of the camp of the Philistines three companies to plunder. One company went towards the way of Ephra to the land of Sual;
<ASV> Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was.
<ASV> Then the remnant went down to the nobles; the people of Yahweh went down for him against the mighty.
<ASV> So her husband Elkanah said to her, "Do what seems right to you; stay until you wean him. Only may Yahweh fulfill his word." So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.
<ASV> Pursue peace with all, and holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord:
<ASV> They said to one another, "Who has done this thing?" When they inquired and asked, they said, "Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing."
<ASV> And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.
<ASV> And the woman saw that it was Saul, and she gave a loud cry, and said to Saul, Why have you made use of deceit? for you are Saul.
<ASV> And an evil spirit from the Lord came on Saul, when he was seated in his house with his spear in his hand; and David made music for him.
<ASV> We will take ten men of a hundred out of all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to bring victuals for the army, that we might fight against Gabaa of Benjamin, and render to it for its wickedness, what it deserveth.
<ASV> and Benjamin cometh out to meet them from Gibeah on the second day, and destroy among the sons of Israel again eighteen thousand men -- to the earth; all these are drawing sword.
<ASV> and thou hast built an altar to Jehovah thy God on the top of this stronghold, by the arrangement, and hast taken the second bullock, and caused to ascend a burnt-offering with the wood of the shrine which thou cuttest down.'
<ASV> and thou hast heard what they speak, and afterwards are thy hands strengthened, and thou hast gone down against the camp.' And he goeth down, he and Phurah his young man, unto the extremity of the fifties who  in the camp;
<ASV> And [they of] Beth-shemesh were reaping the wheat-harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
<ASV> And the Philistines say, `Who hath done this?' And they say, `Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken away his wife, and giveth her to his companion;' and the Philistines go up, and burn her and her father with fire.
<ASV> What more shall I say? For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets;
<ASV> But will not the man by whom the Son of God has been crushed under foot, and the blood of the agreement with which he was washed clean has been taken as an unholy thing, and who has had no respect for the Spirit of grace, be judged bad enough for a very much worse punishment?
<ASV> You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; because of this God, your God, has anointed you with the olive oil of joy more than your companions.
<ASV> And the spirit of the Lord was in him, and he judged Israel. And he went out to fight, and the Lord delivered into his hands Chusan Rasathaim king of Syria, and he overthrew him.
<ASV> They have come in unto the land of Zuph, and Saul hath said to his young man who  with him, `Come, and we turn back, lest my father leave off from the asses, and hath been sorrowful for us.'
<ASV> Saul said, "Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son." Jonathan was selected.
<ASV> Then all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who went with David, answered and said, "Because they didn't go with us, we will not give them anything of the plunder that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart."
<ASV> For the man who comes into his rest has had rest from his works, as God did from his.
<ASV> Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.
<ASV> After that the children of Judah went down to make war on the Canaanites living in the hill-country and in the south and in the lowlands.
<ASV> And another went by the way of Beth-horon, and the third turned to the way of the border, above the valley of Seboim towards the desert.
<ASV> Now no skilled craftsman could be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, "So that the Hebrews cannot make swords or spears for themselves."
<ASV> Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread. Those who were hungry are satisfied. Yes, the barren has borne seven. She who has many children languishes.
<ASV> I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. May Yahweh the Judge be judge today between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon."
<ASV> And David is in all his ways acting wisely, and Jehovah  with him,
<ASV> In that he says, "A new covenant", he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.
<ASV> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
<ASV> And Samson calleth unto Jehovah, and saith, `Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray Thee, and strengthen me, I pray Thee, only this time, O God; and I am avenged -- vengeance at once -- because of my two eyes, on the Philistines.'
<ASV> And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
<ASV> And Saul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from God is troubling you.
<ASV> There is no one as holy as Yahweh, For there is no one besides you, nor is there any rock like our God.
<ASV> And the chiefs in Issachar were with Deborah; and Issachar likewise was with Barak; into the valley he was sent to get him from behind. Among the clans of Reuben were great decisions of the heart.
<ASV> who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God;
<ASV> And the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah. And the children of Israel said, Tell , how was this wickedness?
<ASV> And the man riseth to go, and his father-in-law presseth on him, and he turneth back and lodgeth there.
<ASV> then this will not be an obstacle for you or a stumbling block of conscience for my lord either by the shedding of blood without cause or by my lord taking matters into his own hands. And when Yahweh does good to my lord, then remember your female servant."
<ASV> And, now, let, I pray thee, my lord the king hear the words of his servant: if Jehovah hath moved thee against me, let Him accept a present; and if the sons of men -- cursed  they before Jehovah, for they have cast me out to-day from being admitted into the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.
<ASV> By faith Noah, having been warned about things not yet seen, out of reverence constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family, by which he pronounced sentence on the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.
<ASV> And David saith unto Abner, `Art not thou a man? and who  like thee in Israel? but why hast thou not watched over thy lord the king? for one of the people had come in to destroy the king, thy lord.
<ASV> When his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. Before the deadline,
<ASV> and David heareth that Nabal  dead, and saith, `Blessed  Jehovah who hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and His servant hath kept back from evil, and the wickedness of Nabal hath Jehovah turned back on his own head;' and David sendeth and speaketh with Abigail, to take her to him for a wife.
<ASV> Be the Lord judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and judge my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.
<ASV> And the townsmen of Shechem put secret watchers on the tops of the mountains, and they made attacks on all who went by on the road and took their goods; and word of this came to Abimelech.
<ASV> Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; and I thy handmaid did not see the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
<ASV> Only let your behaviour do credit to the good news of Christ, so that if I come and see you or if I am away from you, I may have news of you that you are strong in one spirit, working together with one soul for the faith of the good news;
<ASV> This thing is not good, that thou hast done: as the Lord liveth, you are the sons of death, who have not kept your master, the Lord's anointed. And now where is the king's spear, and the cup of water, which was at his head?
<ASV> Not that I have already received this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on if indeed I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ.
<ASV> That you may approve the better things, that you may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ,
<ASV> Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath,
<ASV> And when David's servants came, they spoke to Nabal all these words in David's name: and then held their peace.
<ASV> And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.
<ASV> And the chief men of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in thy hand, that we should give bread to thine army?
<ASV> But afterwards they cried to the Lord, and said: We have sinned, because we have forsaken the Lord, and have served Baalim and Astaroth: but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
<ASV> And her husband rose up and went after her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again; and his servant was with him, and a couple of asses. And she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet him.
<ASV> Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
<ASV> And the king saith to Doeg, `Turn round thou, and come against the priests;' and Doeg the Edomite turneth round, and cometh himself against the priests, and putteth to death in that day eighty and five men bearing a linen ephod,
<ASV> They occupied all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon up to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness up to the Jordan.
<ASV> Are they not all helping spirits, who are sent out as servants to those whose heritage will be salvation?
<ASV> And David receiveth from her hand that which she hath brought to him, and to her he hath said, `Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and accept thy face.'
<ASV> and they turn and flee toward the wilderness, unto the rock of Rimmon; and they glean of them in the highways five thousand men, and follow after them unto Gidom, and smite of them two thousand men.
<ASV> So make images of the growths caused by your disease and of the mice which are damaging your land; and give glory to the God of Israel: it may be that the weight of his hand will be lifted from you and from your gods and from your land.
<ASV> Now Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah, of the daughters of the Philistines;
<ASV> And there escapeth one son of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, and his name  Abiathar, and he fleeth after David,
<ASV> And Nabal gave them his answer and said, Who is David? who is the son of Jesse? there are a number of servants in these days running away from their masters.
<ASV> And Manoah said to his wife, Death will certainly be our fate, for it is a god whom we have seen.
<ASV> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
<ASV> But the things that were gain to me, the same I have counted loss for Christ.
<ASV> For where there is a will, it is a necessity for the death of the one who made the will to be established.
<ASV> and she is dwelling under the palm-tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-El, in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel go up unto her for judgment.
<ASV> And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.
<ASV> For you both had compassion on them that were in bands, and took with joy the being stripped of your own goods, knowing that you have a better and a lasting substance.
<ASV> For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
<ASV> Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same: that, through death, he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the devil:
<ASV> Then the men of Beth Shemesh asked, "Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? And to whom shall it go up from us?"
<ASV> The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. When the fugitives of Ephraim said, "Let me go over," the men of Gilead said to him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If he said, "No";
<ASV> Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.
<ASV> And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." And he pushed with all his strength, and the house fell on the rulers and all of the people who were with him. And the dead whom he killed in his death were more than those he killed in his life.
<ASV> But the servant said in answer, I have here a fourth part of a shekel of silver: I will give that to the man of God, and he will give us directions about our way.
<ASV> But there was a strong tower in the middle of the city, and all the men, women, and lords of the city fled there and shut themselves in; and they went up to the roof of the tower.
<ASV> But in the middle of the town there was a strong tower, to which all the men and women of the town went in flight and, shutting themselves in, went up to the roof of the tower.
<ASV> And inasmuch as [it is] not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests,
<ASV> That the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
<ASV> David answered the priest, and said to him, "Truly, women have been kept from us as usual these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was only a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?"
<ASV> And Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.
<ASV> Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
<ASV> And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
<ASV> And when the Philistine, taking note, saw David, he had a poor opinion of him: for he was only a boy, red-haired and good-looking.
<ASV> and a frontlet of brass  on his feet, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders,
<ASV> Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel, after weeping for him, had put his body in its last resting-place in Ramah, his town. And Saul had put away from the land all those who had control of spirits and who made use of secret arts.
<ASV> Now therefore, O king, come down. According to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part will be to deliver him up into the king's hand."
<ASV> And David riseth and fleeth on that day from the face of Saul, and cometh in unto Achish king of Gath;
<ASV> And they said, O Lord, the God of Israel, why has this fate come on Israel, that today one tribe has been cut off from Israel?
<ASV> And the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, "Let the woman be attentive to all that I said.
<ASV> And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest,  shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed continually.
<ASV> Then the old man said, Peace be with thee; only let all thy wants lie on me; but lodge not in the street.
<ASV> And Eliab, his oldest brother, hearing what David said to the men, was moved to wrath against David, and said, Why have you come here? Into whose care have you given that little flock of sheep in the waste land? I have knowledge of your pride and the evil of your heart, you have come down to see the fight.
<ASV> And Saul said, Blessed be ye of Jehovah; for ye have compassion upon me.
<ASV> Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.
<ASV> Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
<ASV> For not to messengers did He subject the coming world, concerning which we speak,
<ASV> And Nobe the city of the priests he smote with the edge of his sword, both men and women, children, and sucklings, and ox and ass, and sheep with the edge of the sword.
<ASV> He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.
<ASV> And he taketh the elders of the city, and the thorns of the wilderness, and the threshing instruments, and teacheth by them the men of Succoth,
<ASV> You will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp." Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.
<ASV> And David answereth and saith, `Lo, the king's spear; and let one of the young men pass over, and receive it;
<ASV> but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries.
<ASV> Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? Be it far from me! Don't let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing of all this, less or more."
<ASV> For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.
<ASV> And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.
<ASV> Now these things having been prepared in this way, the priests enter into the first tent continually as they accomplish their service,
<ASV> Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent-pin and a hammer and went up to him quietly, driving the pin into his head, and it went through his head into the earth, for he was in a deep sleep from weariness; and so he came to his end.
<ASV> Gideon took ten men from his servants, and he did just as Yahweh told him; and because he was too afraid of his father's family and the men of the city to do it during the day, he did it during night.
<ASV> And about ten days after, the Lord sent disease on Nabal and death came to him.
<ASV> and he, because of his remaining -- to the age, hath the priesthood not transient,
<ASV> And the children of Israel said unto the Lord, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.
<ASV> Are they not getting, are they not parting the goods among them: a young girl or two to every man; and to Sisera robes of coloured needlework, worked in fair colours on this side and on that, for the neck of the queen?
<ASV> And he cried to the Lord desiring help against the Madianites.
<ASV> And Saul saith, `Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and we prey upon them till the light of the morning, and leave not a man of them.' And they say, `All that is good in thine eyes do.' And the priest saith, `Let us draw near hither unto God.'
<ASV> When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow. He said, "Behold, I dreamed a dream; and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat."
<ASV> Then Samson put his arms round the two middle pillars supporting the house, putting his weight on them, on one with his right hand and on the other with his left.
<ASV> but emptied himself by taking the form of a slave, by becoming in the likeness of people. And being found in appearance like a man,
<ASV> Then Samuel took Saul and his servant into the guest room, and made them take the chief place among all the guests who were there, about thirty persons.
<ASV> So he made clear to them the way into the town, and they put it to the sword; but they let the man and all his family get away safe.
<ASV> Be ye followers of me, brethren, and observe them who walk so as you have our model.
<ASV> Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim. The men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, "You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the middle of Ephraim, and in the middle of Manasseh."
<ASV> And David sent ten young men, and said to them, Go up to Carmel and go to Nabal, and say kind words to him in my name;
<ASV> And behold the men of that city in the night beset the house wherein I was, intending to kill me, and abused my wife with an incredible fury of lust, so that at last she died.
<ASV> So you must show loyal love to your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you. But if there is guilt in me, then kill me yourself! But why should you bring me to your father?"
<ASV> And David said, `Only, in vain I have kept all that this  hath in the wilderness, and nothing hath been looked after of all that he hath, and he turneth back to me evil for good;
<ASV> and God sendeth an evil spirit between Abimelech and the masters of Shechem, and the masters of Shechem deal treacherously with Abimelech,
<ASV> and Kish  father of Saul, and Ner father of Abner  son of Ahiel.
<ASV> For this reason, as we are circled by so great a cloud of witnesses, putting off every weight, and the sin into which we come so readily, let us keep on running in the way which is marked out for us,
<ASV> And when Samuel was turning round to go away, Saul took the skirt of his robe in his hand, and the cloth came away.
<ASV> Then Manue prayed to the Lord, and said: I beseech thee, O Lord, that the mail of God, whom thou didst send, may come again, and teach us what we ought to do concerning the child that shall be born.
<ASV> quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee.
<ASV> What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
<ASV> Gilead abode beyond Jordan; And Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat on the sea-shore, And abode in his creeks.
<ASV> Yahweh's anger burned against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.
<ASV> Give ear to those who are rulers over you, and do as they say: for they keep watch over your souls, ready to give an account of them; let them be able to do this with joy and not with grief, because that would be of no profit to you.
<ASV> And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?
<ASV> I am able to do all things through him who gives me strength.
<ASV> Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.

<ASV> This is the agreement which I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws in their hearts, writing them in their minds; he said,

<ASV> And Jonathan said to him: To morrow is the new moon, and thou wilt be missed:

<ASV> and they say to him, `Keep silent, lay thy hand on thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us for a father and for a priest: is it better thy being a priest to the house of one man, or thy being priest to a tribe and to a family in Israel?'
<ASV> They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at Oreb's rock, and Zeeb they killed at Zeeb's wine press; and pursued Midian. Then they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.

<ASV> Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.

<ASV> And the Lord hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:

<ASV> For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;

<ASV> And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north side of Bethel, toward the sun-rising of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.

<ASV> And the man said to Eli, I am he that came out of the battle, and I have fled to-day out of the battle. And he said, What has taken place, my son?

<ASV> And Saul was very angry and this saying was unpleasing to him; and he said, They have given David credit for tens of thousands, and to me for only thousands: what more is there for him but the kingdom?
<ASV> He said to him, "O Lord, how shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house."

<ASV> And Saul, with Jonathan his son and the people who were with them, was waiting in Geba in the land of Benjamin: but the tents of the Philistines were in Michmash.
<ASV> For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
<ASV> And David addeth again to ask at Jehovah, and Jehovah answereth him, and saith, `Rise, go down to Keilah, for I am giving the Philistines into thy hand.'
<ASV> And the men of the city said to Jehoash, "Bring out your son so that he may die, for he has pulled down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah that was beside it."

<ASV> I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land.
<ASV> Do not regard your female servant as worthless, but because of the extent of my worries and my provocation I have spoken all of this."
<ASV> According to all the works that they have done from the day of My bringing them up out of Egypt, even unto this day, when they forsake Me, and serve other gods -- so they are doing also to thee.
<ASV> When Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, they told him, "Look, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi."

<ASV> And when the cry of the children of Israel, because of Midian, came before the Lord,
<ASV> And when the seventh day came, they said to the wife of Samson: Soothe thy husband, and persuade him to tell thee what the riddle meaneth. But if thou wilt not do it, we will burn thee, and thy father's house. Have you called us to the wedding on purpose to strip us?
<ASV> And the God of the peace, who did bring up out of the dead the great shepherd of the sheep -- in the blood of an age-during covenant -- our Lord Jesus,
