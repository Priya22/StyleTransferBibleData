<BBE> And Jonathan saith to David, `What doth thy soul say? -- and I do it for thee.'
<BBE> Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Get up yourself, and strike us, for as is the man, so is his power." So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.
<BBE> And the Philistine said to David: Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with a staff? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
<BBE> Saul said, "Tell David, 'The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies.'" Now Saul thought he would make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
<BBE> And Jonathan saith, `Far be it from thee! for I certainly do not know that the evil hath been determined by my father to come upon thee, and I do not declare it to thee.'
<BBE> And Jehovah was with Judah; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill-country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
<BBE> The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, "No, my brothers, please don't act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, don't do this folly.
<BBE> And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.

<BBE> But God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore the name thereof was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi, unto this day.
<BBE> and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.
<BBE> And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
<BBE> And Manoah saith unto his wife, `We certainly die, for we have seen God.'
<BBE> And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that comes up? for to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who smites him, him will the king enrich with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
<BBE> and Michal taketh the teraphim, and layeth on the bed, and the mattress of goats'  she hath put  his pillows, and covereth with a garment.
<BBE> And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.
<BBE> And Saul sware to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
<BBE> of  doctrine of washings, and of imposition of hands, and of resurrection of  dead, and of eternal judgment;
<BBE> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.
<BBE> So the servants of Saul informed him, saying, "This is what David said."
<BBE> who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
<BBE> But the man wouldn't stay that night, but he rose up and departed, and toward Jebus (also called Jerusalem). With him were a couple of saddled donkeys. His concubine also was with him.
<BBE> So that with good courage we say, "The Lord is my helper. I will not fear. What can man do to me?"
<BBE> Naphtali didn't drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labor.
<BBE> And David left the things he was carrying in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran into the ranks, and came and saluted his brethren.
<BBE> Now therefore if thou have any thing at hand, though it were but five loaves, give me, or whatsoever thou canst find.
<BBE> I give thanks to my God upon my every remembrance of you,
<BBE> And David's men said to him, Behold the day of which Jehovah said to thee, Behold, I will give thine enemy into thy hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good to thee. And David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.
<BBE> and all this assembly do know that not by sword and by spear doth Jehovah save, that the battle  Jehovah's, and He hath given you into our hand.'
<BBE> Let your gentleness be known of all men. The Lord  near.
<BBE> Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
<BBE> And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah. And Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they might not dwell in Shechem.
<BBE> For that leaders led in Israel, For that the people willingly offered themselves, Bless Jehovah!
<BBE> Now when Samuel heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of Yahweh.
<BBE> And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.
<BBE> And the Lord being angry with Israel, delivered them into the hands of Chusan Rasathaim king of Mesopotamia, and they served him eight years.
<BBE> and so, having patiently endured, he did obtain the promise;
<BBE> The bows of the mighty men are broken; And they that stumbled are girded with strength.
<BBE> They said, "Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah."
<BBE> Jonathan got up from the table enraged, and did not eat on the second day of the new moon because he was upset about David, because his father had disgraced him.
<BBE> Just as he turned his shoulder to depart from Samuel, God changed his heart. And all these signs were fulfilled on that day.
<BBE> Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways,
<BBE> And he returned after awhile to marry her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and there was a swarm of wild honey bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
<BBE> And Saul said to Achias: Bring the ark of the Lord. (For the ark of God was there that day with the children of Israel.)
<BBE> The messengers therefore came to Gabaa of Saul: and they spoke these words in the hearing of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.
<BBE> Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord:
<BBE> So then take your stand again and see this great thing that Yahweh is going to do before your eyes.
<BBE> Therefore Yahweh's anger burned against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.
<BBE> And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free. But he knew not that Jehovah was departed from him.
<BBE> He went from there to Penuel, and he spoke similarly to them; and the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth answered.
<BBE> Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.
<BBE> And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof unto this day.
<BBE> (for the law perfected nothing,) and the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God.
<BBE> And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and they followed Abimelech, and put  to the hold, and burned the hold with fire upon them. And all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
<BBE> Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people, then all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
<BBE> Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.
<BBE> And why will ye harden your heart, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? When he had wrought mightily among them, did they not let them go, and they departed?
<BBE> Then Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.
<BBE> But the fig tree said to them, 'Should I stop producing my sweetness, and my good crop, to go sway over the trees?'
<BBE> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are ill-treated, as being yourselves also in the body.
<BBE> And Saul went on this side of the mountain: and David and his men were on the other side of the mountain: and David despaired of being able to escape from the face of Saul: and Saul and his men encompassed David and his men round about to take them.
<BBE> and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence by my bonds, are more abundantly bold -- fearlessly to speak the word.
<BBE> Let brotherly love abide.
<BBE> and others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
<BBE> The same night the Lord said to him: Arise, and go down into the camp: because I have delivered them into thy hand.
<BBE> As saith the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be upon thee.
<BBE> And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, and he performed on her the vow that he had vowed; and she had known no man. And it became a fixed custom in Israel,
<BBE> But a certain dreadful expectation of judgment, and the rage of a fire which shall consume the adversaries.
<BBE> And Jonathan went up creeping on his hands and feet, and his armourbearer after him. And some fell before Jonathan, others his armourbearer slew as he followed him.
<BBE> For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, he hath also rejected thee from being king.
<BBE> and I have declared to him that I am judging his house -- to the age, for the iniquity which he hath known, for his sons are making themselves vile, and he hath not restrained them,
<BBE> The children of Benjamin did so, and took wives for themselves, according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off. They went and returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them.
<BBE> By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with the unbelieving, having received the spies in peace.
<BBE> He had a son whose name was Saul, a young and handsome man. There was not a man from the Israelites more handsome than he was; from his shoulders up, he was taller than all the people.
<BBE> And Samuel said to Saul: Thou hast done foolishly, and hast not kept the commandments of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee. And if thou hadst not done thus, the Lord would now have established thy kingdom over Israel for ever.
<BBE> as it is righteous for me to think this as to you all, because ye have *me* in your hearts, and that both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings ye are all participators in my grace.
<BBE> And Jehovah leaveth these nations, so as not to dispossess them hastily, and did not give them into the hand of Joshua.
<BBE> Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.
<BBE> And they rise early in the morning, and bow themselves before Jehovah, and turn back, and come in unto their house in Ramah, and Elkanah knoweth Hannah his wife, and Jehovah remembereth her;
<BBE> By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers, receiving the spies with peace.
<BBE> and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He selleth them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the Bene-Ammon,
<BBE> For he, of whom these things are spoken, is of another tribe, of which no one attended on the altar.
<BBE> Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:
<BBE> I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound. In everything and in all things I am initiated both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer privation.
<BBE> And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
<BBE> But my righteous one shall live by faith: And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.
<BBE> And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
<BBE> And they set up for themselves Micah's graven image, which he had made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
<BBE> Micah said to him, "Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food." So the Levite went in.
<BBE> And it cometh to pass when Saul hath turned back from after the Philistines, that they declare to him, saying, `Lo, David  in the wilderness of En-gedi.'
<BBE> And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
<BBE> And the priest giveth to him the holy thing, for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence which is turned aside from the presence of Jehovah to put hot bread in the day of its being taken away.
<BBE> Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed; all these slang stones at a hair , and missed not.
<BBE> And it answered them: Can I forsake my wine, that cheereth God and men, and be promoted among the other trees?
<BBE> Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.
<BBE> And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
<BBE> but if you can't declare it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing." They said to him, "Tell us your riddle, that we may hear it."
<BBE> And David swore again and again, and said, Thy father certainly knows that I have found favour in thy sight: and he has thought, Jonathan shall not know this, lest he be grieved; but truly  Jehovah liveth, and  thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.
<BBE> And it came to pass when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions, and they were with him.
<BBE> And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart; and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.
<BBE> Now there was no smith to be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had taken this precaution, lest the Hebrews should make them swords or spears.
<BBE> for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye showed toward his name, in that ye ministered unto the saints, and still do minister.
<BBE> and I have taken my bread, and my water, and my flesh, which I slaughtered for my shearers, and have given  to men whom I have not known whence they !'
<BBE> So the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of Yahweh, because the men treated the offering of Yahweh with contempt.
<BBE> Yahweh repays to each one his righteousness and his faithfulness, for Yahweh gave you into my hand today, but I was not willing to stretch out my hand against Yahweh's anointed.
<BBE> saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;
<BBE> So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him commander of a thousand, so he marched in and out at the front of the army.
<BBE> And when the Philistine looked, and beheld David, he despised him. For he was a young man, ruddy, and of a comely countenance.
<BBE> The Philistines gathered their camps for battle and they were gathered at Socoh which belongs to Judah. They camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes Dammim.
<BBE> And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed art thou of Jehovah: I have fulfilled the word of Jehovah.
<BBE> for it is witnessed of him, Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.
<BBE> And when I saw that ye would not save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah gave them into my hand. Why then are ye come up to me this day, to fight against me?
<BBE> Therefore my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
<BBE> And he said unto his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
<BBE> And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight against my land?
<BBE> Then came the word of Jehovah unto Samuel, saying,
<BBE> And Samuel departed to Ramatha: but Saul went up to his house in Gabaa.
<BBE> And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
<BBE> Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.
<BBE> And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him: thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
<BBE> And Samuel took a little vial of oil and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said: Behold, the Lord hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance, and thou shalt deliver his people out of the hands of their enemies, that are round about them. And this shall be a sign unto thee, that God hath anointed thee to be prince.
<BBE> Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.
<BBE> The woman hurried and ran, and told her husband, and said to him, "Behold, the man who came to me that day has appeared to me,"
<BBE> For in finding fault with them he says, "Behold, days are coming, says the Lord, when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,
<BBE> But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
<BBE> and they turn before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness, and the battle hath followed them; and those who  from the city are destroying them in their midst;
<BBE> but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;
<BBE> Jonathan said, "Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then wouldn't I tell you that?"
<BBE> He went also into Gaza, and saw there a woman a harlot, and went in unto her.
<BBE> So when David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. The head of the Philistine was in his hand.
<BBE> And it was told Saul that David was come to Ceila: and Saul said: The Lord hath delivered him into my hands, and he is shut up, being come into a city, that hath gates and bars.
<BBE> And therefore these were fathered from one man, and he being as good as dead, as the stars of heaven in number and like the innumerable sand by the shore of the sea.
<BBE> And (as it may be said) even Levi who received tithes, paid tithes in Abraham:
<BBE> Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
<BBE> And so terrible was that which was seen, Moses said: I am frighted, and tremble.
<BBE> And Gideon taketh ten men of his servants, and doth as Jehovah hath spoken unto him, and it cometh to pass, because he hath been afraid of the house of his father, and the men of the city, to do  by day, that he doth  by night.
<BBE> Now, brethren, I desire you should know, that the things which have happened to me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel:
<BBE> Then said I: Behold, I come to do thy will, O God: he taketh away the first, that he may establish that which followeth.
<BBE> And Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom would not hearken. And they also sent to the king of Moab; and he would not. And Israel abode in Kadesh.
<BBE> If one man shall sin against another, God may be appeased in his behalf: but if a man shall sin against the Lord, who shall pray for him? And they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them.
<BBE> Then David got up and came to the place where Saul had encamped, and David saw the place where Saul was lying down, as well as Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. (Now Saul was lying in the encampment, and the army was encamping around him.)
<BBE> For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don't grow weary, fainting in your souls.
<BBE> how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
<BBE> And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.
<BBE> And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
<BBE> So Jonathan went up on his hands and his feet, with his armor bearer after him. They fell before Jonathan and then his armor bearer would kill them after him.
<BBE> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.
<BBE> And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
<BBE> For I have known that this shall fall out to me for salvation, through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Christ Jesus,
<BBE> And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
<BBE> So he restored them to his mother, who said to him: I have consecrated and vowed this silver to the Lord, that my son may receive it at my hand, and make a graven and a molten god, so now I deliver it to thee.
<BBE> And the youth cometh unto the place of the arrow which Jonathan hath shot, and Jonathan calleth after the youth, and saith, `Is not the arrow beyond thee?'
<BBE> And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried out, and fled.
<BBE> but ye have come to mount Zion; and to  city of  living God, heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels,
<BBE> And he said to him, Behold now, a man of God is in this city, and the man is held in honour; all that he says comes surely to pass. Let us now go thither: perhaps he will shew us the way that we should go.
<BBE> for our God is a consuming fire.
<BBE> and Saul saith unto the Kenite, `Go, turn aside, go down from the midst of Amalek, lest I consume thee with it, and thou didst kindness with all the sons of Israel, in their going up out of Egypt;' and the Kenite turneth aside from the midst of Amalek.
<BBE> So he took the ancients of the city and thorns and briers of the desert, and tore them with the same, and cut in pieces the men of Soccoth.
<BBE> But Samuel ministered before Jehovah, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
<BBE> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.
<BBE> Sisera summoned all his chariots—all nine hundred chariots of iron—and the entire army that was with him from Harosheth Haggoyim to the wadi of Kishon.
<BBE> As to the asses which are lost to thee this day three days, set not thy heart to them, for they have been found; and to whom  all the desire of Israel?' is it not to thee and to all thy father's house?'
<BBE> But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.
<BBE> for he also ailed nigh to death, but God did deal kindly with him, and not with him only, but also with me, that sorrow upon sorrow I might not have.
<BBE> And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
<BBE> He said to them, "Follow me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand." They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn't allow any man to pass over.
<BBE> And they see -- the men of Israel, who  beyond the valley, and who  beyond the Jordan -- that the men of Israel have fled, and that Saul and his sons have died, and they forsake the cities and flee, and Philistines come in, and dwell in them.
<BBE> However I will not altogether take away a man of thee from my altar: but that thy eyes may faint and thy soul be spent: and a great part of thy house shall die when they come to man's estate.
<BBE> But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.
<BBE> And David delivereth all that the Amalekites have taken; also his two wives hath David delivered.
<BBE> And who will hearken to you in this matter? For as his share is that goes down to the battle, so shall his share be that abides by the baggage: they shall share alike.
<BBE> And the people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
<BBE> And I trust in the Lord, that I myself also shall come to you shortly.
<BBE> And so they went on the journey they had begun. But Michas seeing that they were stronger than he, returned to his house.
<BBE> But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.
<BBE> For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth vegetation usable to those people for whose sake it is also cultivated, shares a blessing from God.
<BBE> And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
<BBE> But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.
<BBE> And Jephthah fleeth from the face of his brethren, and dwelleth in the land of Tob; and vain men gather themselves together unto Jephthah, and they go out with him.
<BBE> Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring God's ark here." For God's ark was with the children of Israel at that time.
<BBE> And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and had departed from Saul.
<BBE> For ye came not near to the mount touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
<BBE> and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
<BBE> For many live, of whom I spoke about to you many times, but now speak about even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,
<BBE> However, some worthless men said, "How can this man deliver us?" So they despised him and brought no gift to him, but he kept silent.
<BBE> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they served Baalim.
<BBE> And they remembered not the Lord their God, who delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies round about:
<BBE> Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men remained from the entire army of the people of the east; those that fell in battle were one hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen.
<BBE> And Gedeon sent messengers into all mount Ephraim, saying: Come down to meet Madian, and take the waters before them to Bethbera and the Jordan. And all Ephraim shouted, and took the waters before them and the Jordan as far as Bethbera.
<BBE> And when he had named the ark of God, he fell from his stool backwards by the door, and broke his neck, and died. For he was an old man, and far advanced in years: and he judged Israel forty years.
<BBE> And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land. And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodged there.
<BBE> and cometh in unto his house, and taketh the knife, and layeth hold on his concubine, and cutteth her in pieces to her bones -- into twelve pieces, and sendeth her into all the border of Israel.
<BBE> And Gideon saith unto God, `Let not Thine anger burn against me, and I speak only this time; let me try, I pray Thee, only this time with the fleece -- let there be, I pray Thee, drought on the fleece alone, and on all the earth let there be dew.'
<BBE> And there is a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danite, and his name  Manoah, his wife  barren, and hath not borne;
<BBE> The priest answered David, and said, "I have no common bread, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women."
<BBE> And for the selfsame thing do you also rejoice, and congratulate with me.
<BBE> For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
<BBE> Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the Lord done this thing unto thee this day.
<BBE> Then Saul said to Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal said to Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I slay thee?
<BBE> And the olive-tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to wave over the trees?
<BBE> yea, if in truth and in sincerity ye have acted with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, rejoice ye in Abimelech, and he doth rejoice -- even he -- in you;

<BBE> The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, "There is one tribe cut off from Israel today.

<BBE> Naphtali drove not out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to taskwork.
<BBE> And all the common people came into a forest, in which there was honey upon the ground.
<BBE> And he presented the gifts to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was exceeding fat.

<BBE> Now the appointed time for the men of Israel with the ambush was that they sent up for them a great amount of smoke from the city.
<BBE> you subjected all things under his feet. For in subjecting all things, he left nothing that was not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him,

<BBE> On the seventh day, they said to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Isn't that so?"
<BBE> David replied, "What have I done now? I merely asked a question!
<BBE> This thing is not good that thou hast done. As Jehovah liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept watch over your lord, Jehovah's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.
<BBE> Saul said, "Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son." Jonathan was selected.

<BBE> Be not carried away with various and strange doctrines; for [it is] good that the heart be confirmed with grace, not meats; those who have walked in which have not been profited by .
<BBE> And I also have said, I do not cast them out from your presence, and they have been to you for adversaries, and their gods are to you for a snare.'

<BBE> The weight of the ornamental rings of gold that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, apart from the crescents, pendants, and purple garments that were on the kings of Midian, and apart from the pendants that were on the necks of their camels.
<BBE> And David layeth these words in his heart, and is exceedingly afraid of the face of Achish king of Gath,
<BBE> And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clothed with a coat of mail with scales, and the weight of his coat of mail was five thousand sicles of brass:

<BBE> Zebulun is a people  jeoparded their lives unto death, Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
<BBE> (for they were not able to bear what was enjoined: And if a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;
<BBE> for my father fought and risked his life for you and delivered you from the hand of Midian;

<BBE> He had thirty sons, and as many daughters, whom he sent abroad, and gave to husbands, and took wives for his sons of the same number, bringing them into his house. And he judged Israel seven years:

<BBE> For ye have need of endurance in order that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.
<BBE> Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?

<BBE> Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.
<BBE> And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he also saved Israel.
<BBE> and to them that were in Hormah, and to them that were in Bor-ashan, and to them that were in Athach,
<BBE> I have a maiden daughter, and this man hath a concubine, I will bring them out to you, and you may humble them, and satisfy your lust: only, I beseech you, commit not this crime against nature on the man.
<BBE> But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

<BBE> And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
<BBE> Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have not been drinking wine or strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.

<BBE> Then David said to Achish, "Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, then let them give me a place in one of the country towns that I can live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?"

<BBE> And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
<BBE> And the word of Jehovah is unto Samuel, saying,
<BBE> And Gideon cometh in unto the Jordan, passing over, he and the three hundred men who  with him -- wearied, and pursuing,
<BBE> "Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh will do before your eyes.
<BBE> and we desire each one of you the same diligence to shew, unto the full assurance of the hope unto the end,
<BBE> And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;
<BBE> And the Israelites went up against the descendants of Benjamin on the third day, and they took up positions against Gibeah as before.
<BBE> God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?
<BBE> they have compassed the Benjamites -- they have pursued them -- with ease they have trodden them down till over-against Gibeah, at the sun-rising.
<BBE> He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants.

<BBE> For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
<BBE> And Samuel did that which Jehovah spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
<BBE> sometimes being publicly exposed both to insults and to afflictions, and sometimes becoming sharers with those who were treated in this way.
<BBE> Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample.
<BBE> By faith we understand the worlds were created by the word of God, in order that what is seen did not come into existence from what is visible.
<BBE> And the men of the city rise early in the morning, and lo, broken down hath been the altar of Baal, and the shrine which is by it hath been cut down, and the second bullock hath been offered on the altar which is built.
<BBE> He said to him, "O Lord, how shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house."

<BBE> She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. Let her observe all that I commanded her."
<BBE> And all this assembly shall know, that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for it is his battle, and he will deliver you into our hands.
<BBE> And Samuel said: How shall I go? for Saul will hear of it, and he will kill me. And the Lord said: Thou shalt take with thee a calf of the herd, and thou shalt say: I am come to sacrifice to the Lord.
<BBE> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
<BBE> And in the same way also you rejoice and rejoice with me.
<BBE> But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, "Give us a king to judge us." Samuel prayed to Yahweh.
<BBE> David said furthermore, As the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.
<BBE> They said to him, "Hold your peace, put your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?"
<BBE> So Jonathan rose from the table in great anger, and did not eat bread on the second day after the new moon. For he was grieved for David, because his father had put him to confusion.
<BBE> And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.
<BBE> According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded, but with all confidence, as always, so now also shall Christ be magnified in my body, wither it be by life, or by death.
<BBE> And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?
<BBE> For you have need of endurance, in order that after you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.
<BBE> But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Don't look on his face, or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for I don't see as man sees. For man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart."
<BBE> Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever Jehovah our God hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.
<BBE> And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.

<BBE> and they crush and oppress the sons of Israel in that year -- eighteen years all the sons of Israel  are beyond the Jordan, in the land of the Amorite, which  in Gilead.
<BBE> Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither had the word of the Lord been revealed to him.
<BBE> For, as the Lord liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
<BBE> And there cometh a man of God unto Eli, and saith unto him, `Thus said Jehovah, Was I really revealed unto the house of thy father in their being in Egypt, before Pharaoh's house,
<BBE> but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.
<BBE> And they passed thence to mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
<BBE> And Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this  will I treat with you, that I thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
<BBE> Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
<BBE> He said to his mother, "The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me. I took it." His mother said, "May Yahweh bless my son!"
<BBE> And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
<BBE> Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they slept with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
<BBE> And there goeth out a man of the duellists from the camps of the Philistines, Goliath  his name, from Gath; his height  six cubits and a span,
<BBE> And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
<BBE> For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he didn't restrain them.
<BBE> Then the woman came in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, until it was light.
<BBE> And they run and bring him thence, and he stationed himself in the midst of the people, and he is higher than any of the people from his shoulder and upward.
<BBE> And Samson said to them, Let me now propound a riddle to you; if ye clearly explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find  out, then I will give you thirty shirts, and thirty changes of garments.
<BBE> And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
<BBE> Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
<BBE> By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before  translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God.
<BBE> And the whole congregation sent and spake to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace unto them.

<BBE> And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.

<BBE> So he brought down the people to the water; and Yahweh said to Gideon, "Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set him by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink."
<BBE> For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
<BBE> And the spirit of the Lord began to be with him in the camp of Dan, between Saraa and Esthaol.
<BBE> And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.
<BBE> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: and he delivered them into the hands of the Philistines forty years.
<BBE> How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
<BBE> that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles."
<BBE> And the children of Israel remembered not Jehovah their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;
<BBE> For then they would have ceased to be offered: because the worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer:
<BBE> And they hear regarding it -- the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead -- that which the Philistines have done to Saul,
<BBE> And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.
<BBE> So they crossed over and went their way, and the sun went down on them beside Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
<BBE> And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute.
<BBE> and he sent messengers to Abimelech in Tormah, saying, "Look, Gaal son of Ebed and his relatives are coming to Shechem, and they are stirring up the city against you.
<BBE> Now the Philistine came out morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
<BBE> but he, because of his continuing for ever, has the priesthood unchangeable.
<BBE> Samson said to them, "If you behave like this, surely I will take revenge on you, and after that I will cease."
<BBE> After Abimelech, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to save Israel. He lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.
<BBE> Now the Lord had revealed to the ear of Samuel the day before Saul came, saying:
<BBE> And he consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
<BBE> And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.

<BBE> And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back his servant from evil: and the evil-doing of Nabal hath Jehovah returned upon his own head.

<BBE> Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman that has a spirit of Python, that I may go to her and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has a spirit of Python at En-dor.
<BBE> And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?

<BBE> There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him into his service.
<BBE> in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, Thou didst not delight,
<BBE> and they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down unto them: and they provoked Jehovah to anger.
<BBE> And David saith unto his heart, `Now am I consumed one day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing for me better than that I diligently escape unto the land of the Philistines, and Saul hath been despairing of me -- of seeking me any more in all the border of Israel, and I have escaped out of his hand.'
<BBE> And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.
<BBE> And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place.
<BBE> And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
<BBE> for they were not bearing that which is commanded, `And if a beast may touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or with an arrow shot through,'
<BBE> but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
<BBE> Then David said to him, "To whom do you belong, and from where are you? The young man said, "I am an Egyptian young man, a servant of an Amalekite man, but my master abandoned me because I became ill three days ago.
<BBE> but ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.
<BBE> and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, 'Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.'

<BBE> And the children of Benjamin boldly issued out of the city, and seeing their enemies flee, pursued them a long way, so as to wound and kill some of them, as they had done the first and second day, whilst they fled by two highways, whereof one goeth up to Bethel, and the other to Gabaa, and they slew about thirty men:

<BBE> Then, indeed, fathers of our flesh we have had, chastising , and we were reverencing ; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of the spirits, and live?
<BBE> And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah; now Ehud was dead.
<BBE> And all the people said to Samuel, Pray to Jehovah thy God for thy servants, that we die not; for we have added to all our sins the wickedness to ask for ourselves a king.
<BBE> Then said Micah, Now know I that Jehovah will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.
<BBE> Then the Israelites cried out to Yahweh, saying, "We have sinned against you; we have abandoned our God and served the Baals."
<BBE> And Jehovah doth for Himself as He hath spoken by my hand, and Jehovah rendeth the kingdom out of thy hand, and giveth it to thy neighbour -- to David.
<BBE> And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is he not the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his overseer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem! and why should *we* serve him?
<BBE> Be strong, and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Strengthen yourselves like men, and fight!"
<BBE> Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
<BBE> Abide with me, fear not; for he that seeks my life seeks thy life; for with me thou art in safe keeping.
<BBE> But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
<BBE> Then I grabbed my concubine and cut her into pieces, and I sent her throughout all the territory of Israel's inheritance; for they committed a shameful and disgraceful thing in Israel.

<BBE> and, now, rise by night, thou and the people who  with thee, and lay wait in the field,
<BBE> And Jehovah addeth to appear in Shiloh, for Jehovah hath been revealed unto Samuel, in Shiloh, by the word of Jehovah.

<BBE> who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.

<BBE> And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
<BBE> Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,
<BBE> Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe.
<BBE> And Yahweh threw Sisera and all his chariots and army into confusion before the edge of Barak's sword; and Sisera dismounted from his chariot and fled on foot.
<BBE> Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
<BBE> And Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; and whithersoever he turned himself, he discomfited .
<BBE> And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.
<BBE> And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand.
<BBE> And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded, saying, Go and draw unto mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
<BBE> But if you shall not be able to declare it, you shall give me thirty shirts and the same number of coats. They answered him: Put forth the riddle that we may hear it.
<BBE> And he himself also stripped off his clothes, and prophesied, himself also, before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?
<BBE> They said, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that there should be one tribe lacking in Israel today?"
<BBE> But Yahweh's Spirit came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together to follow him.
<BBE> In that day I establish unto Eli all that I have spoken unto his house, beginning and completing;
<BBE> make you perfect in every good work to do His will, doing in you that which is well-pleasing before Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom  the glory -- to the ages of the ages! Amen.

<BBE> But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
<BBE> And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Jehovah, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
<BBE> But Christ being come high priest of the good things to come, by the better and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, (that is, not of this creation,)

<BBE> And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it kill us not, and our people. For there was deadly alarm throughout the city: the hand of God was very heavy there;
<BBE> And Jephthah vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
<BBE> And this  the thing which ye do; every male, and every woman knowing the lying of a male, ye devote.'
<BBE> And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;
<BBE> Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Jehovah that hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Jehovah; for they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.
<BBE> And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
<BBE> And as he talked with them, that baseborn man whose name was Goliath, the Philistine, of Geth, shewed himself coming up from the camp of the Philistines: and he spoke according to the same words, and David heard them.
<BBE> Now the sons of Eli were wicked men. They didn't know Yahweh.

<BBE> Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith, To-day if ye shall hear his voice,
<BBE> And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

<BBE> They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
<BBE> And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life:
<BBE> Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
<BBE> And David said to him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
<BBE> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,

<BBE> However, all of Israel and Judah were loving David, for he was going forth and marching ahead of them.
<BBE> And Saul taketh three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and goeth to seek David and his men, on the front of the rocks of the wild goats,

<BBE> And the old man raised his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city, and he said, "Where are you going, and from where do you come?"
<BBE> Nevertheless the Lord raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
<BBE> And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;

<BBE> And have you completely forgotten the exhortation which instructs you as sons? "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, or give up when you are corrected by him.

<BBE> she shall not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither shall she drink wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean: all that I commanded her shall she observe.
<BBE> And I pursued after them, and struck them, and delivered it out of their mouth: and they rose up against me, and I caught them by the throat, and I strangled and killed them.

<BBE> If ye will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken unto his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of Jehovah your God, well:
<BBE> So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;
<BBE> And David heareth in the wilderness that Nabal is shearing his flock,
<BBE> and Jehovah doth turn back to each his righteousness and his faithfulness, in that Jehovah hath given thee to-day into  hand, and I have not been willing to put forth my hand against the anointed of Jehovah,

<BBE> looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it;
<BBE> And Adonibezec fled: and they pursued after him and took him, and cut off his fingers and toes.

<BBE> Gilead's wife also bore for him sons; and the sons of his wife grew up and drove Jephthah away, and they said to him, "You will not inherit the house of our father because you are the son of another woman."
<BBE> and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.

<BBE> Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
<BBE> And betimes in the morning at sun rising set upon the city. And when he shall come out against thee with his people, do to him what thou shalt be able.
<BBE> and build an altar unto Jehovah thy God upon the top of this stronghold, in the orderly manner, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shalt cut down.
<BBE> Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels: thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, and hast set him over the works of thy hands:
<BBE> Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
<BBE> And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

<BBE> And the men of Beth-Shemesh say, `Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? and unto whom doth He go up from us?'
<BBE> And the men of Israel were joined together that day; and Saul adjured the people, saying: Cursed be the man that shall eat food till evening, till I be revenged of my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food:
<BBE> And the men did so, and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;
<BBE> And he brought them before the king of Moab; and they abode with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.
<BBE> He answered them: Go in peace, the Lord looketh on your way, and the journey that you go.
<BBE> The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich, he humbleth and he exalteth.
<BBE> Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
<BBE> And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
<BBE> When David realized that Saul had gone out to seek his life, David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.

<BBE> Because thou obeyedst not the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath Jehovah done this thing unto thee this day.
<BBE> for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,
<BBE> And the king saith, `Ask thou whose son this  -- the young man.'
<BBE> See that you refuse him not that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke upon the earth, much more shall not we, that turn away from him that speaketh to us from heaven.
<BBE> being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which  by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise.
<BBE> Manasseh did not drive out Beth-Sean and its towns, or Taanach and its towns, or the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; the Canaanites were determined to live in this land.

<BBE> And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:

<BBE> Jonathan therefore made a covenant with the house of David: and the Lord required it at the hands of David's enemies.

<BBE> And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
<BBE> But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words.
<BBE> Then David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, and he forbore to go forth.

<BBE> And Saul saith, `From Amalek they have brought them, because the people had pity on the best of the flock, and of the herd, in order to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God, and the remnant we have devoted.'
<BBE> And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel played the harlot after it there; and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.
<BBE> And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
<BBE> And David taking the head of the Philistine brought it to Jerusalem: but his armour he put in his tent.

<BBE> And Jonathan said to him: To morrow is the new moon, and thou wilt be missed:

<BBE> For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
<BBE> And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between thee and me for ever.
<BBE> I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
<BBE> So the day following the people went out into the field. And it was told Abimelech.
<BBE> Yahweh said to him, "Peace be to you! Don't be afraid. You shall not die."
<BBE> Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
<BBE> And in the morning the man arose, and opened the door that he might end the journey he had begun: and behold his concubine lay before the door with her hands spread on the threshold.
<BBE> And he said to her, What is his form? And she said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
<BBE> and oh that this people were in my hand -- then I turn Abimelech aside;' and he saith to Abimelech, `Increase thy host, and come out.'

<BBE> And Jephthah passeth over unto the Bene-Ammon to fight against them, and Jehovah giveth them into his hand,

<BBE> Then Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, answered and said, "I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
<BBE> And David taketh the spear, and the cruse of water at the pillow of Saul, and they go away, and there is none seeing, and there is none knowing, and there is none awaking, for all of them are sleeping, for a deep sleep  Jehovah hath fallen upon them.
<BBE> The children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
<BBE> and ye have made images of your emerods, and images of your mice that are corrupting the land, and have given honour to the God of Israel; it may be He doth lighten His hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land;
<BBE> But if you keep doing evil, you will be consumed, both you and your king."
<BBE> So then, get up by night, you and the army that is with you, and lie in ambush in the field.
<BBE> And it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.

<BBE> for every command having been spoken, according to law, by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of the calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he both the book itself and all the people did sprinkle,
<BBE> They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword; then they burned the city with fire.

<BBE> And there is a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name  Micah,
<BBE> The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened cakes and put them on this rock; pour the broth over it." And he did so.
<BBE> But you know his proven character, that like a child with a father he served with me for the gospel.
<BBE> For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
<BBE> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.

<BBE> And David said: O Lord God of Israel, thy servant hath heard a report, that Saul designeth to come to Ceila, to destroy the city for my sake:
<BBE> How much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy of who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
<BBE> Watch out, brothers, lest there be in some of you an evil, unbelieving heart, with the result that you fall away from the living God.
<BBE> And the Spirit of Jehovah will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
<BBE> And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.
<BBE> And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.

<BBE> Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.

<BBE> And the Ziphites go up unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, `Is not David hiding himself with us in fortresses, in the forest, in the height of Hachilah, which  on the south of the desolate place?
<BBE> Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him. He said, "It is Yahweh. Let him do what seems good to him."
<BBE> And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?

<BBE> And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.
<BBE> And princes in Issachar  with Deborah, Yea, Issachar  right with Barak, Into the valley he was sent on his feet. In the divisions of Reuben, Great  the decrees of heart!
<BBE> And what more do I say? For the time would fail me telling of Gideon, and Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah, and David and Samuel, and of the prophets:
<BBE> So then, hand over the men, the perverse lot, who are in Gibeah, so that we may kill them and purge this wickedness from Israel." But the descendants of Benjamin were not willing to listen to the voice of their relatives, the Israelites.
<BBE> any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from mercies, by two or three witnesses, doth die,

<BBE> And it came to pass when Samuel was old, that he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel.
<BBE> Now when he was come to the place of the Jawbone, and the Philistines shouting went to meet him, the spirit of the Lord came strongly upon him: and as the flax is wont to be consumed at the approach of fire, so the bands with which he was bound were broken and loosed.
<BBE> Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,
<BBE> who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;

<BBE> Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.

<BBE> But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders thereof.

<BBE> To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
<BBE> Grace be with you all. Amen.
<BBE> that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

<BBE> and he smiteth them from Aroer, and unto thy going in to Minnith, twenty cities, and unto the meadow of the vineyards -- a very great smiting; and the Bene-Ammon are humbled at the presence of the sons of Israel.

<BBE> And he passeth over through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passeth over through the land of Shalisha, and they have not found; and they pass over through the land of Shaalim, and they are not; and he passeth over through the land of Benjamin, and they have not found.

<BBE> only of meats and drinks and divers washings, ordinances of flesh, imposed until  time of setting things right.

<BBE> And Saul saith, `Thus do ye say to David, There is no delight to the king in dowry, but in a hundred foreskins of the Philistines -- to be avenged on the enemies of the king;' and Saul thought to cause David to fall by the hand of the Philistines.
<BBE> Are they not all spirits engaged in special service, sent on assignment for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation?
<BBE> Saul said, "God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan."

<BBE> Perhaps he is now dividing the spoils, and the fairest of the women is chosen out for him: garments of divers colours are given to Sisara for his prey, and furniture of different kinds is heaped together to adorn the necks.
<BBE> And he brought him into his house, and gave the asses provender; and they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
<BBE> Then the princes of the Philistines said, "What about these Hebrews?" Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, "Isn't this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away to today?"
<BBE> And the two wives of David have been taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelite;

<BBE> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?
<BBE> And Saul saith unto David, `Blessed  thou, my son David, also working thou dost work, and also prevailing thou dost prevail.' And David goeth on his way, and Saul hath turned back to his place.

<BBE> `And, now, lo, I have known that thou dost certainly reign, and the kingdom of Israel hath stood in thy hand;

<BBE> They went up to the city. As they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.
<BBE> For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
<BBE> For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things, is God.
<BBE> Then Abimelech went up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up and laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people that was with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, do as I have done.
<BBE> But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.

<BBE> As they went up the ascent to the city, they met maidens going forth to draw water; and they said to them, Is the seer here?
<BBE> Be careful about nothing; but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;
<BBE> and they call the name of that place Bochim, and sacrifice there to Jehovah.
<BBE> And so then here is the king walking about before you. Now I am old and gray, but my sons (look at them!) are with you; and I have walked about before you from my youth until this day.
<BBE> Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.
<BBE> And Samson said to them, This time I am blameless toward the Philistines, though I do them harm.
<BBE> So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
<BBE> Yahweh said to the children of Israel, "Didn't I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
<BBE> For every one that is a partaker of milk, is unskillful in the word of justice: for he is a little child.
<BBE> Here I am: testify against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I injured? or of whose hand have I received any ransom and blinded mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it to you.
<BBE> Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
<BBE> for, behold, you shall conceive, and give birth to a son. No razor shall come on his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb. He shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines."
<BBE> and choose him out of all the tribes of Israel, to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear the ephod before me? and I gave unto the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel.

<BBE> If indeed then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for the people had their law given to them in connexion with *it*, what need [was there] still that a different priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be named after the order of Aaron?
<BBE> The boy therefore came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot: and Jonathan cried after the boy, and said: Behold the arrow is there further beyond thee.
<BBE> And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

<BBE> And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
<BBE> When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.
<BBE> The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:

<BBE> And the trees said to the vine, 'You, come rule over us.'

<BBE> And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people.
<BBE> Remember your prelates who have spoken the word of God to you; whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation,
<BBE> And when the children of Israel saw this in the battle (for the children of Benjamin thought they fled and pursued them vigorously, killing thirty men of their army)

<BBE> Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:
<BBE> And they declare to David, saying, `Lo, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and they are spoiling the threshing-floors.'

<BBE> So they inquired again of Yahweh, "Did the man come here?"  And Yahweh said, "Look, he is hiding himself among the baggage."
<BBE> And so then, do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of Yahweh, for the king of Israel has gone out to seek a single flea, as one hunts a partridge in the mountains."

<BBE> For ye are not come unto a mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,

<BBE> Then Saul said to him, "Whose son are you, young man?" And David said, "I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."

<BBE> God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,

<BBE> And Jesse calleth unto Abinadab, and causeth him to pass by before Samuel; and he saith, `Also on this Jehovah hath not fixed.'

<BBE> They asked him: Say then, Scibboleth, which is interpreted, An ear of corn. But he answered, Sibboleth, not being able to express an ear of corn by the same letter. Then presently they took him and killed him in the very passage of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim two and forty thousand.
<BBE> Who being sent away, went into the land of Hethim, and built there a city, and called it Luza: which is so called until this day.
<BBE> So Saul said to his servants, "Search for me a woman who is a medium so that I may go to her and inquire of her." His servants said to him, "Look there is a woman who is a medium in Endor."

<BBE> And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.
<BBE> So they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods before them.
<BBE> and Samuel saith, `Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I pray for you unto Jehovah.'
<BBE> And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith: And let all the angels of God adore him.
<BBE> By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he being dead yet speaketh.

<BBE> And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in to her, into the tent, and she covered him with the quilt.

<BBE> For ye have not come to [the mount] that might be touched and was all on fire, and to obscurity, and darkness, and tempest,
<BBE> They that were full have hired themselves out for bread; and the hungry are  no more: Even the barren beareth seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
<BBE> Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,

<BBE> And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the Lord was with them.

<BBE> There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither plunder, nor anything that they had taken to them. David brought back all.
<BBE> Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the Lord is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?
<BBE> Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
<BBE> Delilah said to Samson, "Until now, you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what you might be bound." He said to her, "If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web."

<BBE> And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
<BBE> So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
<BBE> Do not neglect hospitality, because through this some have received angels as guests without knowing it.
<BBE> And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying: What shall be given to the man that shall kill this Philistine, and shall take away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
<BBE> He called quickly to the young man carrying his weapons, and he said to him, "Draw your sword and kill me, so that they will not say of me, 'A woman killed him.'" So the young man stabbed him, and he died.
<BBE> For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
<BBE> And if I live, thou shalt shew me the kindness of the Lord: but if I die,
<BBE> And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
<BBE> And Samuel died; and all Israel were gathered together, and lamented him; and they buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
<BBE> because also in Thessalonica, both once and again to my need ye sent;
<BBE> Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
<BBE> And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.
<BBE> She said, "Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.
<BBE> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
<BBE> and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous people made perfect,
<BBE> But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, that is, not of this creation:
<BBE> Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;
<BBE> And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.
<BBE> In Israel's dwelling in Heshbon and in its towns, and in Aroer and in its towns, and in all the cities which  by the sides of Arnon three hundred years -- and wherefore have ye not delivered them in that time?
<BBE> Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.
<BBE> But the children of Israel returning, put all the remains of the city to the sword, both men and beasts, and all the cities and villages of Benjamin were consumed with devouring flames.

<BBE> And this shall be the sign to thee, which shall come upon thy two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die, both of them.
<BBE> Because of the voice of those who divide [the spoil] in the midst of the places of drawing water; There they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah, His righteous acts toward his villages in Israel. Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates.
<BBE> Then Samuel said, "Bring Agag the king of the Amalekites here to me!" Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."
<BBE> but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
<BBE> After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where are the outposts of the Philistines; and it shall come to pass, when thou comest thither, into the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with lute and tambour and pipe and harp before them; and they themselves prophesying.
<BBE> And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.
<BBE> And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
<BBE> For although by this time you should be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the revelations of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.
<BBE> When Gideon came, a man was recounting a dream to his friend, and he said, "Behold, I had a dream; a round loaf of barley bread was tumbling into the camp of Midian, and it came up to the tent, it struck it, and it fell and turned it upside down so that the tent fell."
<BBE> Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.
<BBE> But Barak pursued after the chariots and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim, and all of Sisera's army fell to the edge of the sword; no one was left.
<BBE> And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
<BBE> Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
<BBE> However, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel and they said, "No, but there must be a king over us,
<BBE> And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel.
<BBE> And they rose up early in the morning and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her.
<BBE> and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;
<BBE> And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
<BBE> Then Jonathan said, "Look, we are about to go over to the men; and we will show ourselves to them.
<BBE> Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
<BBE> Whenever they went out, the hand of Yahweh was against them to harm them, just as Yahweh warned, and just as Yahweh had sworn to them. And they were very distressed.
<BBE> if he be able to fight with me, and have smitten me, then we have been to you for servants; and if I am able for him, and have smitten him, then ye have been to us for servants, and have served us.'
<BBE> They are going down in the extremity of the city, and Samuel hath said unto Saul, `Say to the young man that he pass on before us (and he passeth on), and thou, stand at this time, and I cause thee to hear the word of God.'
<BBE> And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.
<BBE> And Saul said: Cast lots between me, and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
<BBE> This thing that you have done is not good. As Yahweh lives, surely you people deserve to die since you have not kept watch over your lord, over Yahweh's anointed one! So then, see where the king's spear is and the jar of water that was near his head!"
<BBE> And he saith to him, `Far be it! thou dost not die; lo, my father doth not do anything great or small and doth not uncover mine ear; and wherefore doth my father hide from me this thing? this  is not.'
<BBE> He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.
<BBE> Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
<BBE> Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.
<BBE> And Samuel said, Has Jehovah delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, As in hearkening to the voice of Jehovah? Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice, Attention than the fat of rams.
<BBE> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
<BBE> Let your gentleness be made known to all people. The Lord is near.
<BBE> As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and said the same words; and David heard them.
<BBE> And your seed and your vineyards he doth tithe, and hath given to his eunuchs, and to his servants.
<BBE> And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise; behold, when I come to the extremity of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
<BBE> Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the Lord is with him.
<BBE> So then, we can say with confidence, "The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid. What will man do to me?"
<BBE> but he, because he continues forever, holds the priesthood permanently.
<BBE> Just as he mentioned the ark of God, he fell from his chair backwards against the side of the gate. He broke his neck and died, because the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.
<BBE> If thus he say: Good; peace  for thy servant; and if it be very displeasing to him -- know that the evil hath been determined by him;
<BBE> And Abimelech abideth in Arumah, and Zebul casteth out Gaal and his brethren from dwelling in Shechem.
<BBE> and the land resteth forty years. And Othniel son of Kenaz dieth,
<BBE> There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God.
<BBE> And the war is severe against the Philistines all the days of Saul; when Saul hath seen any mighty man, and any son of valour, then he doth gather him unto himself.
<BBE> So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together: and the damsel's father said unto the man, Be pleased, I pray thee, to tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.
<BBE> And the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in strongholds in the wood, on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the waste?
<BBE> And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "What type were the men whom you killed at Tabor?" And they said, "They were like you; each one of them had the appearance of the sons of the king."
<BBE> So then, swear to me by Yahweh that you will not cut off my descendants after me and that you will not wipe out my name from my father's house."
<BBE> And the three eldest of the sons of Jesse had gone and followed Saul to the battle; and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and the second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
<BBE> And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, thou art barren and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive and bear a son.
<BBE> They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. Then Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.
<BBE> He said to them, "Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed is witness today, that you have not found anything in my hand." They said, "He is witness."
<BBE> Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
<BBE> And the Lord said to Samuel: Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee. For they have not rejected thee, but me, that I should not reign over them.
<BBE> And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
<BBE> and I deliver you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all your oppressors, and I cast them out from your presence, and I give to you their land,
<BBE> So then, be careful and do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean,
<BBE> by faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by a saying of God, in regard to the things seen not having come out of things appearing;
<BBE> Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
<BBE> So Abimelech and all the army that was with him got up by night, and they lay in ambush against Shechem in four divisions.
<BBE> Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.

<BBE> Now Gideon had seventy sons who had come out of his loins, for he had many wives.

<BBE> Then I said, 'Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me) to do your will, O God.'"

<BBE> Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you or be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;

And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or these years, and I have found nothing in him since the day of his falling away [to me] to this day?
<BBE> For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
<BBE> For it was becoming to Him, because of whom  the all things, and through whom  the all things, many sons to glory bringing, the author of their salvation through sufferings to make perfect,

<BBE> And Samson's wife wept before him, and she said, "You must hate me; you do not love me. You told the riddle to my people, but you have not explained it to me." He said to her, "I have not explained it to my father and mother. Why should I explain it to you?"
<BBE> But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,

<BBE> For every commandment having been spoken according to  law by Moses to all the people; having taken the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
<BBE> And when his armourbearer saw this, to wit, that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.

<BBE> And David addeth again to ask at Jehovah, and Jehovah answereth him, and saith, `Rise, go down to Keilah, for I am giving the Philistines into thy hand.'
<BBE> And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know anything of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.
<BBE> `I have repented that I caused Saul to reign for king, for he hath turned back from after Me, and My words he hath not performed;' and it is displeasing to Samuel, and he crieth unto Jehovah all the night.
<BBE> And it cometh to pass in the morning, that Jonathan goeth out into the field for the appointment with David, and a little youth  with him.
<BBE> And they slaughter the bullock, and bring in the youth unto Eli,

<BBE> he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said), "Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts."
<BBE> The men did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.
<BBE> So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.
<BBE> But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp.
<BBE> And they oppressed and crushed the children of Israel in that year; eighteen years [they oppressed] all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
<BBE> And Jephthah made a vow to Yahweh, and he said, "If indeed you will give the Ammonites into my hand,

<BBE> saying, "I will proclaim your name to my brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will sing in praise of you."
<BBE> David said to Ahimelech the priest, "The king has commanded me to do something, and has said to me, 'Let no one know anything about the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you. I have sent the young men to a certain place.'
<BBE> And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
<BBE> And Saul saith to his young man, `And lo, we go, and what do we bring in to the man? for the bread hath gone from our vessels, and a present there is not to bring in to the man of God -- what  with us?'
<BBE> And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
<BBE> and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,
<BBE> Of whom we have much to say, and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.
<BBE> And Jonathan said to David, "Come, let us go out to the field." So the two of them went out to the field.
<BBE> And Micah said to him, "From where do you come?" And he said to him, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah; I am going to dwell as a foreigner wherever I can find a place."
<BBE> For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
<BBE> You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
<BBE> the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet hath been manifested the way of the holy , the first tabernacle having yet a standing;
<BBE> There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and childless.
<BBE> Have we need of madmen, that you have brought in this fellow, to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?
<BBE> And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
<BBE> Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.
<BBE> Wherein God, being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;
<BBE> By faith he sojourned as a stranger in the land of promise as a foreign country, having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with  of the same promise;
<BBE> So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
<BBE> On the next day the people rose early, and they built there an altar and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.
<BBE> So God split the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out from it; and he drank, and his spirit returned, and he was revived. Thus he called its name The Spring of Ha-Qore, which is at Lehi to this day.
<BBE> and after the second vail a tabernacle that is called `Holy of holies,'
<BBE> And the war began again, and David went out and fought against the Philistines, and defeated them with a great slaughter, and they fled from his face.
<BBE> Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren;
<BBE> And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
<BBE> And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
<BBE> In that day Debbora and Barac son of Abinoem sung, and said:
<BBE> And as they were going down in the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul: Speak to the servant to go before us, and pass on: but stand thou still a while, that I may tell thee the word of the Lord.
<BBE> saying, "This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you."
<BBE> The raiders went out from the camp of the Philistines in three divisions. One division turned on the road to Ophrah toward the land of Shual.
<BBE> Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.
<BBE> And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.
<BBE> And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that smites this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
<BBE> Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh."
<BBE> For as long as the son of Jesse is alive on the earth, you and your kingdom will not be established! So then, send and bring him to me, for he will surely die!"

<BBE> It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And Samuel was wroth; and he cried unto Jehovah all night.
<BBE> Then the angel of Yahweh reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and he touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and fire went up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of Yahweh went from his sight.
<BBE> Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
<BBE> And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baals, and the Ashtoreths, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook Jehovah, and served him not.
<BBE> And they walked through the wilderness, and went round the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came by the east of the land of Moab, and encamped beyond the Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon is the border of Moab.
<BBE> and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross.
<BBE> And the Spirit of God doth prosper over Saul, in his hearing these words, and his anger burneth greatly,
<BBE> And Zebul said to him, "Where then is your boast, you who said, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Is this not the army that you rejected? Please, go out now and fight against them."
<BBE> And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.
<BBE> After him Abdon, the son of Illel, a Pharathonite, judged Israel:

<BBE> Now this is the main point in what has been said: we have a high priest such as this, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
<BBE> And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearkenest thou to men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
<BBE> And when these went into Micah's house, and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said unto them, What do ye?
<BBE> Not that I have already received this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on if indeed I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ.
<BBE> And he had forty sons and thirty sons' sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
<BBE> And hospitality do not forget; for by this some, being not aware of it, have entertained angels.
<BBE> So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
<BBE> And he said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, then show me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me.
<BBE> And they that were in ambush arose on a sudden out of their coverts, and whilst Benjamin turned their backs to the slayers, went into the city, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
<BBE> And it came to pass that every one that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came out of Egypt to this day. Think it over, advise, and speak.
<BBE> Therefore David inquired of Yahweh, saying, "Shall I go and strike these Philistines?" Yahweh said to David, "Go strike the Philistines, and save Keilah."
<BBE> And there is a man of Benjamin, and his name  Kish, son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Bechorath, son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, mighty of valour,
<BBE> But whithersoever they meant to go, the hand of the Lord was upon them, as he had said, and as he had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.
<BBE> And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day: and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.
<BBE> Then they said, What is the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden hemorrhoids, and five golden mice, the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague is upon them all, and upon your lords.
<BBE> And they called the name of the city Dan, after Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel; but the former name of the city was Laish.
<BBE> And Saul saith unto Jonathan, `Declare to me, what hast thou done?' and Jonathan declareth to him, and saith, `I certainly tasted with the end of the rod that  in my hand a little honey; lo, I die!'
<BBE> Behold, days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
<BBE> Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned himself, he defeated them.
<BBE> And when Saul heard this he was appeased with the words of Jonathan, and swore: As the Lord liveth he shall not be slain.
<BBE> And when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, Saul said: Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
<BBE> For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house.
<BBE> Then David said to his young men: Let every man gird on his sword. And they girded on every man his sword. And David also girded on his sword: and there followed David about four hundred men: and two hundred remained with the baggage.
<BBE> And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?
<BBE> The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there, where there was a great stone. Then they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to Yahweh.
<BBE> make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;
<BBE> saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in  midst of  assembly will I sing thy praises.
<BBE> And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
<BBE> And ye shall make images of your hemorrhoids, and images of your mice that destroy the land, and give glory to the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
<BBE> As to the rest, brethren, as many things as are true, as many as  grave, as many as  righteous, as many as  pure, as many as  lovely, as many as  of good report, if any worthiness, and if any praise, these things think upon;
<BBE> For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,
<BBE> And the Lord said to him: I will be with thee: and thou shalt cut off Madian as one man.
<BBE> For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
<BBE> And Michal daughter of Saul loveth David, and they declare to Saul, and the thing is right in his eyes,
<BBE> And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
<BBE> And the whole assembly sent to speak to the children of Benjamin that were at the cliff of Rimmon, and to proclaim peace to them.
<BBE> And his lord saith unto him, `Let us not turn aside unto the city of a stranger, that is not of the sons of Israel, thither, but we have passed over unto Gibeah.'
<BBE> And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.
<BBE> then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh.
<BBE> And he said to him: What is thy name, that, if thy word shall come to pass, we may honour thee?
<BBE> Wherefore receive this blessing, which thy handmaid hath brought to thee, my lord: and give it to the young men that follow thee, my lord.
<BBE> Please do not let my lord set his heart against this worthless man, Nabal; for as his name, so is he. Nabal is his name, and stupidity is with him! But I, your female servant, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.
<BBE> The men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, saying, "None of us will give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife."
<BBE> Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.
<BBE> Yahweh said, "Judah shall go up. Behold, I have delivered the land into his hand."
<BBE> So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men that same day together.
<BBE> And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
<BBE> And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,
<BBE> Unless perhaps thou art better than Balac the son of Sephor king of Moab: or canst shew that he strove against Israel and fought against him,
<BBE> The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew sword. All these were men of war.
<BBE> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
<BBE> And now behold, I know that thou shalt certainly be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.
<BBE> But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
<BBE> They answered, "We will willingly give them." They spread a garment, and every man threw the earrings of his plunder into it.
<BBE> And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil was come upon them.
<BBE> David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
<BBE> So Saul commanded the people, and numbered them as lambs: two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand of the men of Juda.
<BBE> And they said to Samuel: Cease not to cry to the Lord our God for us, that he may save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
<BBE> But Christ having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,
<BBE> but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,
<BBE> And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
<BBE> And when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.
<BBE> So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
<BBE> And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?
<BBE> and it hath come to pass, she is riding on the ass and is coming down in the secret part of the hill-country, and lo, David and his men are coming down to meet her, and she meeteth them.
<BBE> Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law),
<BBE> and the Philistines set themselves in array to meet Israel, and the battle spreadeth itself, and Israel is smitten before the Philistines, and they smite among the ranks in the field about four thousand men.
<BBE> And the children of Dan sent of their family five men of their whole number, men of valour, from Zoreah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to examine it; and they said to them, Go, examine the land. And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
<BBE> And Jephthah vowed a vow to Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt without fail give the children of Ammon into my hand,
<BBE> Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh, for instructors, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more obey the Father of spirits, and live?
<BBE> Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;
<BBE> And the people fell on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the people ate  with the blood.
<BBE> And the men of Israel returned to the descendants of Benjamin, and they put them to the edge of the sword, both the inhabitants of city and the animals that were found; they also set on fire all the cities that they found.
<BBE> And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
<BBE> And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
<BBE> And the lamp of God is not yet extinguished, and Samuel is lying down in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God ,
<BBE> If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
<BBE> The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" He said to them, "If you hadn't plowed with my heifer, you wouldn't have found out my riddle."
<BBE> And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me.
<BBE> And Gideon saith unto them, `Let me ask of you a petition, and give ye to me each the ring of his prey, for they have rings of gold, for they  Ishmaelites.'
<BBE> And every bad and worthless man, of the men who have gone with David, answereth, yea, they say, `Because that they have not gone with us we do not give to them of the spoil which we have delivered, except each his wife and his children, and they lead away and go.
<BBE> and Saul saith, `I give her to him, and she is to him for a snare, and the hand of the Philistines is on him;' and Saul saith unto David, `By the second -- thou dost become my son-in-law to-day.'
<BBE> Saul sent to Jesse, saying, "Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight."
<BBE> And so he used to do year after year; whenever she went up to the house of Yahweh, she would provoke her so that she would weep and would not eat.
<BBE> And the Lord said to Gedeon: By the three hundred men, that lapped water, I will save you, and deliver Madian into thy hand: but let all the rest of the people return to their place.
<BBE> And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the Lord delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?
<BBE> And I will bring unto thee in the place of the torrent Cison, Sisara the general of Jabin's army, and his chariots, and all his multitude, and will deliver them into thy hand.
<BBE> For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.
<BBE> Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
<BBE> Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.
<BBE> and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame.
<BBE> All the remainder of your household will come to bow down before him for a bit of silver or a loaf of bread and will say, "Please assign me to one of the priestly offices so that I can eat a morsel of bread."'"
<BBE> Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.
<BBE> And they sat down together, and ate and drank. And the father of the young woman said to his son in law: I beseech thee to stay here to day, and let us make merry together.
<BBE> It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, 'Grant them graciously to us, because we didn't take for each man his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, otherwise you would now be guilty.'"
<BBE> Therefore I also said, 'I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.'"
<BBE> If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
<BBE> On the next day after the new moon, the second day, David's place was empty. Saul said to Jonathan his son, "Why doesn't the son of Jesse come to eat, either yesterday, or today?"
<BBE> But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
<BBE> And now as I know that thou shalt surely be king, and have the kingdom of Israel in thy hand:
<BBE> And Samuel said, Was it not when thou wast little in thine eyes that thou  the head of the tribes of Israel, and Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel?
<BBE> So the Lord saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.
<BBE> Then Achish called David, and said unto him, As Jehovah liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not.
<BBE> Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
<BBE> And Saul encamped in Gabaa Hachila, which was over against the wilderness in the way: and David abode in the wilderness. And seeing that Saul was come after him into the wilderness,
<BBE> And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said unto him, Arise, get thee down into the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand.
<BBE> Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of Jehovah. Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, Because they came not to the help of Jehovah, To the help of Jehovah against the mighty.
<BBE> and he said to him, "Thus says Jephthah, 'Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites,
<BBE> for I am pressed by the two, having the desire to depart, and to be with Christ, for it is far better,
<BBE> That which Chemosh thy god causeth thee to possess -- dost thou not possess it? and all that which Jehovah our God hath dispossessed from our presence, -- it we do possess.
<BBE> And Ahimelech answered the king and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and has access to thy secret council, and is honourable in thy house?
<BBE> Though *I* have  trust even in flesh; if any other think to trust in flesh, *I* rather:
<BBE> And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said unto him, Behold, the man of whom I spake to thee! this same shall have authority over my people.
<BBE> And he said to me, 'Look, you will conceive and bear a son, so then, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, for the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth until the day of his death.'"
<BBE> And the Israelites lived in the midst of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
<BBE> Samuel said to the people, "It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
<BBE> And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
<BBE> And he said to them: What you shall see me do, do you the same: I will go into one part of the camp, and do you as I shall do.
<BBE> And David seeth that Saul hath come out to seek his life, and David  in the wilderness of Ziph, in a forest.
<BBE> Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them. So Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
<BBE> and said to him, Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon.
<BBE> David said to Jonathan, "Look, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should certainly sit with the king to eat. You must send me away so that I can hide myself in the field until the third evening.
<BBE> So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.
<BBE> And the sons of Israel draw near unto the sons of Benjamin on the second day,
<BBE> So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
<BBE> And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and he drew near to the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire;
<BBE> Now the people of Beth Shemesh were reaping the wheat harvest in the valley. They lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and they were glad to see it.
<BBE> They that were full before have hired out themselves for bread: and the hungry are filled, so that the barren hath borne many: and she that had many children is weakened.
<BBE> And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.
<BBE> And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron—the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-Arba; and they slew Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
<BBE> saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
<BBE> And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, "What is your name so that when your words come true we may honor you?"
<BBE> When I blow the trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon.
<BBE> Rejoice in the Lord always; again, I say, rejoice.
<BBE> Now Jehovah had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,
<BBE> And the bearer of his weapons seeth that Saul  dead, and he falleth -- he also -- on his sword, and dieth with him;
<BBE> And they laid the ark of God upon the cart, and the little box that had in it the golden mice and the likeness of the emerods.
<BBE> So they told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Again Saul sent messengers a third time, and they also prophesied.
<BBE> And no man taketh the honor unto himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron.
<BBE> And the Ziphites come in unto Saul, at Gibeah, saying, `Is not David hiding himself in the height of Hachilah, on the front of the desert?'
<BBE> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
<BBE> How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?
<BBE> Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
<BBE> not that in respect of want I say , for I did learn in the things in which I am -- to be content;
<BBE> And his companion answereth and saith, `This is nothing save the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel; God hath given into his hand Midian and all the camp.'
<BBE> Then opening the truth of the thing, he said to her: The razor hath never come upon my head, for I am a Nazarite, that is to say, consecrated to God from my mother's womb: if my head be shaven, my strength shall depart from me, and I shall become weak, and shall be like other men.
<BBE> What will we do for them—for the ones being left over—for wives? For we have sworn by Yahweh not to give to them our daughters as wives."
<BBE> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay. At her feet he bowed, he fell. Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
<BBE> Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:
<BBE> And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
<BBE> Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you lived in safety.
<BBE> But Jonathan answered his father Saul and said to him, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"
<BBE> Swear to me by the Lord, that thou wilt not destroy my seed after me, nor take away my name from the house of my father.
<BBE> And Samuel goeth to Ramath, and Saul hath gone unto his house -- to Gibeah of Saul.
<BBE> But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
<BBE> And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.
<BBE> and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel."
<BBE> So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
<BBE> but into the second, the high priest only, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people:
<BBE> So then look! Here is the king you have chosen, for whom you have asked! Look, Yahweh has placed a king over you!
<BBE> And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
<BBE> And Israel set liers in wait against Gibeah, round about.
<BBE> And David said: Will the men of Ceila deliver me, and my men, into the hands of Saul? And the Lord said: They will deliver thee up.
<BBE> who through faith did subdue kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped mouths of lions,
<BBE> Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a prostitute, and went in to her.
<BBE> But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak thus.
<BBE> Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
<BBE> Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.
<BBE> But David laid up these words in his heart, and was exceedingly afraid at the face of Achis the king of Geth.
<BBE> but one has testified somewhere, saying, What is man, that thou rememberest him, or son of man that thou visitest him?
<BBE> And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.
<BBE> And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the Lord; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
<BBE> And after him Ibzan of Beth-Lehem judgeth Israel,
<BBE> But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod.
<BBE> Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, both you, and your son, and your son's son also; for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian."
<BBE> but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.
<BBE> And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it; and they called the name of the city Hormah.
<BBE> are they not all spirits of service -- for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?
<BBE> And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
<BBE> And Saul sweareth to her by Jehovah, saying, `Jehovah liveth, punishment doth not meet thee for this thing.'
<BBE> For otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the ones who worship, having been purified once and for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?
<BBE> From heaven fought the stars, From their courses they fought against Sisera.
<BBE> Forget not to show love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
<BBE> that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death;
<BBE> And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his garments, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Jehovah, and I cannot go back.
<BBE> And Eli  very old, and hath heard all that his sons do to all Israel, and how that they lie with the women who are assembling  the opening of the tent of meeting,
<BBE> that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
<BBE> So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me David your son who is with the sheep."
<BBE> Now at the time that Saul saw David going out against the Philistines, he said to Abner the captain of the army: Of what family is this young man descended, Abner? And Abner said: As thy soul liveth, O king, I know not.
<BBE> So they set up for themselves the carved divine image that Micah had made, all the days that the house of God was in Shiloh.
<BBE> Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.
<BBE> only, whereunto we have attained, by that same rule let us walk.
<BBE> And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.
<BBE> And there was no deliverer, for it was far from Zidon, and they had nothing to do with  man; and it  in the valley that is by Beth-rehob. And they built the city and dwelt therein.
<BBE> And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
<BBE> Do not increase speaking very proud words! Let no arrogance go forth from your mouth, for Yahweh is a God of knowledge whose deeds are not weighed.

<BBE> But the man was not willing to spend the night, and he got up and went; and he arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a pair of saddled donkeys and his concubine.
<BBE> Through him, then, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God  continually, that is, the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name.
<BBE> For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
<BBE> `Also now, station yourselves and see this great thing which Jehovah is doing before your eyes;
<BBE> And Samuel said, Why then dost thou inquire of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?
<BBE> But he turned from the graven images that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret word unto thee, O king. And he said, Be silent! And all that stood by him went out from him.
<BBE> And it came to pass, that from the day the ark of the Lord abode in Cariathiarim days were multiplied, (for it was now the twentieth year,) and all the house of Israel rested following the Lord.
<BBE> And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.
<BBE> And Saul said to Jehovah the God of Israel, Give a perfect ! And Jonathan and Saul were taken, and the people escaped.
<BBE> And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
<BBE> and the people taketh of the spoil of the flock and herd, the first part of the devoted thing, for sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.'
<BBE> And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.
<BBE> Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.
<BBE> So Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them to a room in the building and gave them a place at the head of the invited guests. There were about thirty men.
<BBE> and Moab is humbled in that day under the hand of Israel; and the land resteth eighty years.
<BBE> how shall *we* escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in being spoken  by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who have heard;
<BBE> For it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.
<BBE> For both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:
<BBE> And it shall be in the morning when the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and fall upon the city; and behold, he and the people that is with him shall come out against thee, and thou shalt do with him as thou shalt find occasion.
<BBE> because my father hath fought for you, and doth cast away his life from , and deliver you from the hand of Midian;
<BBE> And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
<BBE> A bronze helmet was on his head, and he was clothed with scale body armor; the weight of the body armor was five thousand bronze shekels.
<BBE> While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
<BBE> And no creature is hidden in the sight of him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of him to whom we must give our account.
<BBE> Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
<BBE> So the two of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, and the Philistines said, "The Hebrews are coming out from the holes in which they have hidden themselves."
<BBE> While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn't you recover them within that time?
<BBE> And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.
<BBE> So I have not sinned against thee, but it is thou who doest me wrong in making war against me. Jehovah, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon!
<BBE> And Jehovah saith unto Samuel, `Hearken to the voice of the people, to all that they say unto thee, for thee they have not rejected, but Me they have rejected, from reigning over them.
<BBE> And he said to his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. The lad ran, and he shot the arrow beyond him.
<BBE> Therefore also God exalted him and graciously granted him the name above every name,
<BBE> and the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and forget Jehovah their God, and serve the Baalim and the shrines.
<BBE> And he saith unto them, `A witness  Jehovah against you: and a witness  His anointed this day, that ye have not found anything in my hand;' and they say, `A witness.'
<BBE> All things do without murmurings and reasonings,
<BBE> for the daughters of Israel to go and lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for forty days of the year.
<BBE> and build an altar to Jehovah thy God upon the top of this strong place in the ordered manner, and take the second bullock, and offer up a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah that thou shalt cut down.
<BBE> David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
<BBE> When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, "Blessed be Yahweh who has vindicated the case of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and he has kept back his servant from evil; but Yahweh has returned the evil of Nabal on his own head." Then David sent and spoke with Abigail to take her for his wife.
<BBE> I prayed for this boy, and Yahweh has given me my request that I asked from him.
<BBE> And the king said, Inquire thou whose son this youth is.
<BBE> And God rendered back the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father in slaying his seventy brethren.
<BBE> and that which is bearing thorns and briers  disapproved of, and nigh to cursing, whose end  for burning;
<BBE> And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy father's house?
<BBE> After a time the Ammonites made war with Israel.
<BBE> He said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me.
<BBE> And the youth Samuel is going on and growing up, and  good both with Jehovah, and also with men.
<BBE> So David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.
<BBE> Neither man nor woman doth David keep alive, to bring in  to Gath, saying, `Lest they declare  against us, saying, Thus hath David done, and thus  his custom all the days that he hath dwelt in the fields of the Philistines.'
<BBE> I said: Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Galgal, and I have not appeased the face of the Lord. Forced by necessity, I offered the holocaust.
<BBE> and had taken captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great. They didn't kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.
<BBE> Or else wouldn't they have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?
<BBE> Then Saul being angry against Jonathan said to him: Thou son of a woman that is the ravisher of a man, do I not know that thou lovest the son of Isai to thy own confusion and to the confusion of thy shameless mother?
<BBE> And Saul said to David: Thou art not able to withstand this Philistine, nor to fight against him: for thou art but a boy, but he is a warrior from his youth.
<BBE> So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.
<BBE> Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
<BBE> She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, "Hasn't Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded, 'Go and lead the way to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
<BBE> And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and he said, "May Yahweh give you an offspring from this woman in place of the petitioned one that she requested from Yahweh." Then they went to their home.
<BBE> By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn't see death, and he was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God.
<BBE> But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator of a better testament, which is established on better promises.
<BBE> To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
<BBE> And Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was drunken to excess; so she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
<BBE> Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfill that which on your part was wanting towards my service.
<BBE> And the men of Israel have turned, and the men of Benjamin are troubled, for they have seen that the evil hath stricken against them --
<BBE> What ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you.
<BBE> And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
<BBE> And Samuel saith unto Saul, `Me did Jehovah send to anoint thee for king over His people, over Israel; and now, hearken to the voice of the words of Jehovah:
<BBE> Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence.
<BBE> Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, because we have both sworn in Yahweh's name, saying, 'Yahweh is between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring, forever.'" He arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.
<BBE> And the destroyer goeth out from the camp of the Philistines -- three detachments; the one detachment turneth unto the way of Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;
<BBE> Yahweh looked at him, and said, "Go in this your might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Haven't I sent you?"
<BBE> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and he hath set the world upon them.
<BBE> Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those that are other men's.
<BBE> Then the trees said to the fig tree, 'You, come rule over us.'
<BBE> For they, their livestock, and their tents would come up like a great number of locusts; they and their camels could not be counted; they came into the land and devoured it.
<BBE> And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
<BBE> And Jonathan told David, saying: Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: wherefore look to thyself, I beseech thee, in the morning, and thou shalt abide in a secret place and shalt be hid.
<BBE> The number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
<BBE> And it came to pass one day when Heli lay in his place, and his eyes were grown dim, that he could not see:
<BBE> And it cometh to pass in the morning, when the wine is gone out from Nabal, that his wife declareth to him these things, and his heart dieth within him, and he hath been as a stone.
<BBE> For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh:
<BBE> When ye go in, ye shall come to a people secure, and the land is spacious in every direction; for God has given it into your hands; [it is] a place where there is no want of anything that is on the earth.
<BBE> and Adoni-Bezek saith, `Seventy kings -- their thumbs and their great toes cut off -- have been gathering under my table; as I have done so hath God repaid to me;' and they bring him in to Jerusalem, and he dieth there.
<BBE> and voweth a vow, and saith, `Jehovah of Hosts, if Thou dost certainly look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and hast remembered me, and dost not forget Thy handmaid, and hast given to Thy handmaid seed of men -- then I have given him to Jehovah all days of his life, and a razor doth not go up upon his head.'
<BBE> And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.
<BBE> And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the Lord is your way wherein ye go.
<BBE> And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities of Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
<BBE> And David subdueth his men by words, and hath not permitted them to rise against Saul; and Saul hath risen from the cave, and goeth on the way;
<BBE> in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,
<BBE> And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
<BBE> The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.
<BBE> Abimelech came up to the tower and fought against it, and he came near the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire.
<BBE> Since, would they not indeed have ceased being offered, on account of the worshippers once purged having no longer any conscience of sins?
<BBE> Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep.
<BBE> Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before Yahweh and returned to their house at Ramah. Then Elkanah had sexual relations with Hannah his wife, and Yahweh remembered her.
<BBE> And David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
<BBE> And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the Lord: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
<BBE> And he said, I have sinned; honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God.
<BBE> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith;
<BBE> Remember your leaders who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their conversation, imitate their faith.
<BBE> And he said to all Israel: Be you on one side, and I with Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people answered Saul: Do what seemeth good in thy eyes.
<BBE> And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground.
<BBE> And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, and he called his name Abimelech.
<BBE> has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds.
<BBE> So the Philistines were afraid, for they said, "God has come to the camp." And they said, "Woe to us, for this has never happened before!
<BBE> for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
<BBE> Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
<BBE> And all the people rise as one man, saying, `None of us doth go to his tent, and none of us doth turn aside to his house;
<BBE> In those days there was no king in Israel, and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for themselves an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day [their lot] had not fallen to them for inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
<BBE> But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
<BBE> And the vine said to them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave over the trees?
<BBE> And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
<BBE> I speak not as it were for want. For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith.
<BBE> And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
<BBE> If one man sins against another, God will judge him; but if a man sins against Yahweh, who will intercede for him?" Notwithstanding, they didn't listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh intended to kill them.
<BBE> But Jonathan didn't hear when his father commanded the people with the oath. Therefore he put out the end of the rod who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened.
<BBE> And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and said to Saul: Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
<BBE> And the ark of Jehovah was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
<BBE> I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,
<BBE> But thy kingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought him a man according to his own heart: and him hath the Lord commanded to be prince over his people, because thou hast not observed that which the Lord commanded.
<BBE> And the people, the chief men of Gilead, said one to another, Who is the man that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
<BBE> Then Saul said to David, "Blessed are you, my son David; you will not only do many things, but also will always succeed!" Then David went on his way and Saul returned to his place.
<BBE> In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
<BBE> And all Israel were gathered together against the city, as one man, with one mind, and one counsel:
<BBE> So David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him all these words.
<BBE> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:
<BBE> But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:
<BBE> And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, saying, "What is between you and me that you have come to me to make war against my land?"
<BBE> And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
<BBE> So he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be mad in their presence. He made scratches on the doors of the gate and let his saliva run down into his beard.
<BBE> And the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we companied with them, when we were in the fields.
<BBE> And Samson and his father and mother went down to Timnah, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah, and suddenly a young lion came roaring to meet him.
<BBE> And having an high priest over the house of God;
<BBE> And David said to him: To whom dost thou belong? or whence dost thou come? and whither art thou going? He said: I am a young man of Egypt, the servant of an Amalecite, and my master left me, because I began to be sick three days ago.
<BBE> So the Philistines fought, and Israel was overthrown, and every man fled to his own dwelling: and there was an exceeding great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
<BBE> And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of terebinths, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that: give it me.
<BBE> For he has said somewhere of the seventh  thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works:
<BBE> and God sendeth an evil spirit between Abimelech and the masters of Shechem, and the masters of Shechem deal treacherously with Abimelech,
<BBE> And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
<BBE> Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah has given us, who has preserved us, and given the troop that came against us into our hand.
<BBE> The Philistines were afraid, for they said, "God has come into the camp." They said, "Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before.
<BBE> And when the people were come down to the waters, the Lord said to Gedeon: They that shall lap the water with their tongues, as dogs are wont to lap, thou shalt set apart by themselves: but they that shall drink bowing down their knees, shall be on the other side.
<BBE> And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.
<BBE> Yahweh's angel said to Manoah, "Though you detain me, I won't eat your bread. If you will prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh." For Manoah didn't know that he was Yahweh's angel.
<BBE> Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,
<BBE> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
<BBE> For a tent was prepared, the first one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the presentation of the loaves, which is called the holy place.
<BBE> And the Lord said to him: Peace be with thee: fear not, thou shalt not die.
<BBE> And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
<BBE> Saul commanded his servants, "Talk with David secretly, and say, 'Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore be the king's son-in-law.'"
<BBE> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, and in all freedom, as always, also now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death,
<BBE> And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.
<BBE> And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
<BBE> And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:
<BBE> And David answered and said, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it.
<BBE> Jesus Christ yesterday and to-day the same, and to the ages;
<BBE> and no one to himself doth take the honour, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron:
<BBE> The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba.
<BBE> Now when Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, "Whose son is this young man, Abner?" And Abner said, "As your soul lives, O king, I do not know."
<BBE> And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered up upon the altar that was built.
<BBE> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord.
<BBE> now, then, may we go forth unto him without the camp, his reproach bearing;
<BBE> And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but by all means return him a trespass-offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
<BBE> And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
<BBE> She brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
<BBE> And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: leave me alone two months, that I may go and descend to the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
<BBE> I thank my God whenever I remember you,
<BBE> And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; ye must at any rate return him a trespass-offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
<BBE> Now when the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
<BBE> And the princes of the Philistines assembled together, to offer great sacrifices to Dagon their god, and to make merry, saying: Our god hath delivered our enemy Samson into our hands.
<BBE> a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
<BBE> And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;
<BBE> And Jehovah said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go: I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.
<BBE> The mountains melted before the face of the Lord, and Sinai before the face of the Lord the God of Israel.
<BBE> that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
<BBE> And the Lord called Samuel again. And Samuel arose and went to Heli, and said: Here am I: for thou calledst me. He answered: I did not call thee, my son: return and sleep.
<BBE> And when David had heard that Nabal was dead, he said: Blessed be the Lord, who hath judged the cause of my reproach at the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil, and the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his head. Then David sent and treated with Abigail, that he might take her to himself for a wife.
<BBE> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.
<BBE> Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor.
<BBE> There is none holy as the Lord is: for there is no other beside thee, and there is none strong like our God.
<BBE> And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
<BBE> Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
<BBE> David said to Achish, "Therefore you will know what your servant can do." Achish said to David, "Therefore I will make you my bodyguard forever."
<BBE> Now these are the nations which Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
<BBE> And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto Jehovah, and wept sore.
<BBE> And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.
<BBE> And there escapeth one son of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, and his name  Abiathar, and he fleeth after David,
<BBE> David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Please bring the ephod here to me." Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
<BBE> And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
<BBE> then it hath been, that which at all cometh out from the doors of my house to meet me in my turning back in peace from the Bene-Ammon -- it hath been to Jehovah, or I have offered up for it -- a burnt-offering.'
<BBE> And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.
<BBE> And Zebee and Salmana fled, and Gedeon pursued and took them, all their host being put in confusion.
<BBE> But if you continue to do wickedness, both you and your king will be swept away."
<BBE> For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
<BBE> On the next day the people went out to the field; and it was reported to Abimelech,

<BBE> All Israel from Dan to Beersheba realized that Samuel was faithful as a prophet to Yahweh.
<BBE> And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of  city as the cattle, and all that was found; even all the cities that were found did they set on fire.
<BBE> and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterwards shall thy hand be strengthened, and thou shalt go down unto the camp. And he went down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the camp.
<BBE> for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,
<BBE> So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated and each man fled to his tent, for the slaughter was very great. Thirty thousand foot soldiers from Israel fell.
<BBE> For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
<BBE> So Saul said, "Bring here to me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings." Then he offered up the burnt offering.
<BBE> And the priest gave him holy ; for there was no bread there but the shew-loaves that were taken from before Jehovah, to put on hot bread in the day when they were taken away.
<BBE> And on the one hand indeed, by reproaches and tribulations, were made a gazingstock; and on the other, became companions of them that were used in such sort.
<BBE> And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set him up a monument, and has turned about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
<BBE> And Saul fell straightway his full length on the earth, and was sore afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night.
<BBE> As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.
<BBE> And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness [of it]; for after what was said:
<BBE> And an angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman, and he said to her, "Behold, you are infertile and have not borne children, but you will conceive and bear a son.
<BBE> For God  not unrighteous to forget your work, and the love which ye have shewn to his name, having ministered to the saints, and  ministering.
<BBE> The name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife was Abigail. Now the woman was wise and beautiful, but the man was stubborn and mean, and he was as his heart.
<BBE> and we have been, even we, like all the nations; and our king hath judged us, and gone out before us, and fought our battles.'
<BBE> But if ye do wickedly, ye shall perish, both ye and your king.
<BBE> When the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?"
<BBE> So Abimelech resided at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives from living in Shechem.
<BBE> And the people say unto Samuel, `Who is he that saith, Saul doth reign over us! give ye up the men, and we put them to death.'
<BBE> And inasmuch as it is not without an oath, (for the others indeed were made priests without an oath;
<BBE> For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of  Holy Spirit,
<BBE> And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
<BBE> Then the evil spirit from Yahweh came upon Saul while he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing a stringed instrument in his hand.
<BBE> And the asses of Kish, father of Saul, are lost, and Kish saith unto Saul his son, `Take, I pray thee, with thee, one of the young men, and rise, go, seek the asses.'
<BBE> So the Israelites removed the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and they served Yahweh alone.
<BBE> And they make a covenant both of them before Jehovah; and David abideth in the forest, and Jonathan hath gone to his house.
<BBE> And they waited till they were ashamed; and behold, he opened not the doors of the upper-chamber, and they took the key, and opened , and behold, their lord lay dead on the earth.
<BBE> So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them.
<BBE> Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?
<BBE> Then the king said, "You inquire whose son this young man is."
<BBE> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice or oblation for ever.
<BBE> And there journey thence, of the family of the Danite, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, six hundred men girded with weapons of war.
<BBE> And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.
<BBE> what then? in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed -- and in this I rejoice, yea, and shall rejoice.
<BBE> And all Israel heard say, Saul has smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and Israel also has become odious to the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
<BBE> and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;
<BBE> and the ambush have hasted, and push against Gibeah, and the ambush draweth itself out, and smiteth the whole of the city by the mouth of the sword.
<BBE> Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
<BBE> You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; because of this God, your God, has anointed you with the olive oil of joy more than your companions.
<BBE> And the cook took up the shoulder, and what was on it, and set  before Saul. And he said, Behold that which has been reserved! set it before thee, eat; for against the set time has it been kept for thee, since I said, I will invite the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
<BBE> And the ambush hasted, and fell upon Gibeah; and the ambush drew along, and smote the whole city with the edge of the sword.
<BBE> Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambush, that they should make a thick column of smoke rise up out of the city.
<BBE> And he said to them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand! And [the people] said, [He is] witness!
<BBE> And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can put forth his hand against Jehovah's anointed, and be guiltless?
<BBE> And he put his hand into his scrip, and took a stone, and cast it with the sling, and fetching it about struck the Philistine in the forehead: and the stone was fixed in his forehead, and he fell on his face upon the earth.
<BBE> And the heads of Succoth say, `Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we give to thy host bread?'
<BBE> for I know that this will turn out to me for deliverance through your prayer and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
<BBE> And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?
<BBE> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
<BBE> and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up; for to-morrow I will give them into thy hand.
<BBE> He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.
<BBE> And David went forth; whithersoever Saul sent him he prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
<BBE> And the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
<BBE> And the masters of Shechem set for him ambushes on the top of the hills, and rob every one who passeth over by them in the way, and it is declared to Abimelech.
<BBE> And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me and told me lies. Now tell me, I pray thee, with what thou mightest be bound.
<BBE> Then David said to Jonathan, "Who will tell me if what your father answers you is harsh?"
<BBE> And David said, As Jehovah liveth, Jehovah will smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.
<BBE> And the five men that went out to spy out the land (that is, Laish) responded and said to their relatives, "Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod, teraphim, and an idol of cast metal? So then, consider what you must do."
<BBE> And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
<BBE> When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, "Come, and let us return, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys, and be anxious for us."
<BBE> For patience is necessary for you; that, doing the will of God, you may receive the promise.
<BBE> And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
<BBE> And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to thy brethren;
<BBE> Do not multiply to speak lofty things, boasting: let old matters depart from your mouth: for the Lord is a God of all knowledge, and to him are thoughts prepared.
<BBE> and Moses indeed  stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken,
<BBE> About ten days later, Yahweh struck Nabal, so that he died.
<BBE> Behold this day thy eyes have seen, that the Lord hath delivered thee into my hand, in the cave, and I had a thought to kill thee, but my eye hath spared thee. For I said: I will not put out my hand against my lord, because he is the Lord's anointed.
<BBE> And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
<BBE> So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped Jehovah.
<BBE> And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?
<BBE> And it was told Sisara, that Barac the son of Ablinoem was gone up to mount Thabor:
<BBE> By faith Noe, having received an answer concerning those things which as yet were not seen, moved with fear, framed the ark for the saving of his house, by the which he condemned the world; and was instituted heir of the justice which is by faith.
<BBE> therefore let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach:
<BBE> Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus,
<BBE> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
<BBE> And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of their spoilers.
<BBE> And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

<BBE> And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
<BBE> Then said David, Jehovah, God of Israel, thy servant hath heard for certain that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
<BBE> Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
<BBE> And also I have lent him to Jehovah: all the days that he lives, he is lent to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.

<BBE> Then the remnant went down to the nobles; the people of Yahweh went down for him against the mighty.
<BBE> When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.
<BBE> Then Saul got up and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
<BBE> Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
<BBE> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel to Ramah.
<BBE> And the sons of Dan raise up for themselves the graven image, and Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Manasseh, he and his sons have been priests to the tribe of the Danite, till the day of the removal of [the people] of the land.
<BBE> but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.
<BBE> Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
<BBE> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
<BBE> And the men of Israel have been distressed on that day, and Saul adjureth the people, saying, `Cursed  the man who eateth food till the evening, and I have been avenged of mine enemies;' and none of the people hath tasted food.
<BBE> Then said Zebul to him, Where is now thy mouth, thou that saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight against them.
<BBE> Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
<BBE> The men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will come out to you and you may do to us whatever seems good to you."
<BBE> By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,

<BBE> While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?

<BBE> Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, "What have you to do with me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?"

<BBE> but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock;
<BBE> Then David strapped on his sword over his fighting attire, but he tried in vain to walk around, for he was not trained to use them. So David said to Saul, "I am not able to walk with these, because I am not trained to use them." So David removed them.

<BBE> And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.
<BBE> And revealed are both of them unto the station of the Philistines, and the Philistines say, `Lo, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hid themselves.'

<BBE> And the sons of Israel say, `Who  he that hath not come up in the assembly out of all the tribes of Israel unto Jehovah?' for the great oath hath been concerning him who hath not come up unto Jehovah to Mizpeh, saying, `He is surely put to death.'
<BBE> Jehovah do so and much more to Jonathan. Should it please my father [to do] thee evil, then I will apprise thee of it, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace; and Jehovah be with thee, as he has been with my father.
<BBE> In like manner do *ye* also rejoice, and rejoice with me.

<BBE> Ephraim also did not slay the Chanaanite that dwelt in Gazer, but dwelt with him.

<BBE> and said, Let me go, I pray thee; for we have a family sacrifice in the city; and my brother himself has commanded me [to be there]; and now, if I have found favour in thy sight, let me go away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. He has therefore not come to the king's table.
<BBE> And Samson called unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.

<BBE> When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

<BBE> fearful  the falling into the hands of a living God.
<BBE> For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.
<BBE> but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,
<BBE> Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no restraint on Yahweh to save by many or by few."
<BBE> For Christ hasn't entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;

<BBE> where your fathers tested me by proving me, and saw my deeds for forty years.
<BBE> "I regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not kept my word." Samuel became angry, and he cried out to Yahweh all night.

<BBE> Where your fathers tried me by proving me, And saw my works forty years.

<BBE> And Samuel saith unto the people, `Fear not; ye have done all this evil; only, turn not aside from after Jehovah -- and ye have served Jehovah with all your heart,

<BBE> They shall perish, but *thou* continuest still; and they all shall grow old as a garment,
<BBE> And all Midian and Amalek and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
<BBE> Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
<BBE> And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.
<BBE> but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the citizens of Shechem and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the citizens of Shechem and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
<BBE> Then Jonathan called David and told him all these words: and Jonathan brought in David to Saul, and he was before him, as he had been yesterday and the day before.
<BBE> thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in subjecting all things to him, he has left nothing unsubject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to *him*,
<BBE> Go and cry out to the gods whom you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your trouble."
<BBE> And sending, they gathered together all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said: What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And the Gethrites answered: Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about.
<BBE> (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?

<BBE> (Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah; and his name was Doeg, the Edomite, chief of the shepherds that  to Saul.)
<BBE> and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but of those believing to a preserving of soul.
<BBE> Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and mourned for him, and buried him at his house at Ramah. Then David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
<BBE> (for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
<BBE> And it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. Then Saul said, God has cast him off into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a city that has gates and bars.
<BBE> And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies round about, so that ye dwelt in safety.
<BBE> Thus if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people received the law, what further need is there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not said to be according to the order of Aaron?
<BBE> And Moses indeed  faithful in all his house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken after;
<BBE> Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.
<BBE> And it answered them: Can I leave my sweetness, and my delicious fruits, and go to be promoted among the other trees?
<BBE> And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him.
<BBE> When Saul inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh didn't answer him by dreams, by Urim, or by prophets.
<BBE> You made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor.
<BBE> having become so much better than the messengers, as he did inherit a more excellent name than they.
<BBE> Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
<BBE> And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.
<BBE> But she answered: Give me a blessing, for thou hast given me a dry land: give me also a watery land. So Caleb gave her the upper and the nether watery ground.

<BBE> Then Elcana her husband said to her: Anna, why weepest thou? and why dost thou not eat? And why dost thou afflict thy heart? Am not I better to thee than ten children?
<BBE> and they are to prove Israel by them, to know whether they obey the commands of Jehovah that He commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
<BBE> And the young men of David turn on their way, and turn back, and come in, and declare to him according to all these words.
<BBE> The Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah opposite Jeshimon?"
<BBE> (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.
<BBE> When he had come into his house, he took a knife, and cut up his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.

<BBE> And she said: The glory is departed from Israel, because the ark of God was taken.
<BBE> And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few.
<BBE> And David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on  way.
<BBE> And the Philistines are gathered, and come in, and encamp in Shunem, and Saul gathereth all Israel, and they encamp in Gilboa,
<BBE> because even in Thessalonica on more than one occasion you sent for my need.
<BBE> Look, this day your eyes have seen that Yahweh gave you today into my hand in the cave, and some said to kill you. But I took pity on you and said, 'I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, because he is Yahweh's anointed one.'
<BBE> In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;
<BBE> She lived under Deborah's palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
<BBE> So then, you also please listen to the voice of your female servant, and let me set before you a morsel of bread, and you eat so that you will have strength in you when you go on your way."
<BBE> Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
<BBE> according to zeal persecuting the assembly! according to righteousness that is in law becoming blameless!
<BBE> to the mark I pursue for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
<BBE> And it answered: Can I leave my fatness, which both gods and men make use of, to come to be promoted among the trees?
<BBE> And Deborah said to Barak, "Get up! This is the day that Yahweh has given Sisera into your hand. Has Yahweh not gone out before you?" So Barak went out from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.
<BBE> And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,
<BBE> And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold, that which hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
<BBE> and the weight of the rings of gold which he asked is a thousand and seven hundred  of gold, apart from the round ornaments, and the drops, and the purple garments, which  on the kings of Midian, and apart from the chains which  on the necks of their camels,
<BBE> Then Abimelech and the divisions that were with him dashed out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, and the two divisions dashed out against all who were in the field, and they killed them.
<BBE> He sent ten young men, and said to them: Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and salute him in my name with peace.
<BBE> The Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he ground at the mill in the prison.
<BBE> Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
<BBE> And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;
<BBE> When Zebul the commander of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he became angry,
<BBE> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come again to me with certainty, and I will go with you. It shall happen, if he is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah."
<BBE> Asher didn't drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;

<BBE> But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.
<BBE> And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Jehovah deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
<BBE> I went out after him, and struck him, and rescued it out of his mouth. When he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and struck him, and killed him.
<BBE> And all the men of Israel have risen from their place, and arrange themselves at Baal-Tamar, and the ambush of Israel is coming forth out of its place, out of the meadow of Gibeah.
<BBE> Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.
<BBE> And David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech trembled at meeting David, and said to him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?
<BBE> And Michas filled his hand, and had the young man with him, for his priest, saying:
<BBE> So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth above the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
<BBE> but if to live in flesh [is my lot], this is for me worth the while: and what I shall choose I cannot tell.
<BBE> Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Return, my son David; for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes today. Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly."
<BBE> and Abimelech son of Jerubbaal goeth to Shechem, unto his mother's brethren, and speaketh unto them, and unto all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
<BBE> By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.
<BBE> And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Manoah, `Of all that I said unto the woman let her take heed;
<BBE> And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled.
<BBE> but emptied himself by taking the form of a slave, by becoming in the likeness of people. And being found in appearance like a man,
<BBE> She let him down through a window. And he went and fled away and escaped.
<BBE> And Saul said to Achimelech: Hear, thou son of Achitob. He answered: Here I am, my lord.
<BBE> that this shall be no stumbling-block to thee, nor offence of heart for my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall deal well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.
<BBE> By faith also of things to come, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.
<BBE> and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and rush upon the city; and, behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
<BBE> He raiseth up the needy from the dust, and lifteth up the poor from the dunghill: that he may sit with princes, and hold the throne of glory. For the poles of the earth are the Lord's, and upon them he hath set the world.
<BBE> And this will we do, if God permit.
<BBE> So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many; the second time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation.
<BBE> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
<BBE> Joash said to all who stood against him, "Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? He who will contend for him, let him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because someone has broken down his altar!"
<BBE> And he saith unto her, `Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water, for I am thirsty;' and she openeth the bottle of milk, and giveth him to drink, and covereth him.
<BBE> Why hast thou abode between the boundaries, To hear lowings of herds? For the divisions of Reuben, Great  the searchings of heart!
<BBE> And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
<BBE> And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people came forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
<BBE> And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies;
<BBE> And Nobe the city of the priests he smote with the edge of his sword, both men and women, children, and sucklings, and ox and ass, and sheep with the edge of the sword.
<BBE> and the Spirit of Jehovah beginneth to move him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.

<BBE> And Samson's wife weepeth for it, and saith, `Thou hast only hated me, and hast not loved me; the riddle thou hast put forth to the sons of my people -- and to me thou hast not declared it;' and he saith to her, `Lo, to my father and to my mother I have not declared  -- and to thee I declare !'
<BBE> And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the Lord liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
<BBE> And over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the propitiatory: of which it is not needful to speak now particularly.
<BBE> Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior; he was the son of a prostitute, and Gilead was his father.
<BBE> And all Israel went down to the Philistines, every man to get his ploughshare, and his hoe, and his axe, and his sickle sharpened,
<BBE> And David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off; a great space  between them.
<BBE> Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<BBE> And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Allow us seven days, and we will send messengers into all the districts of Israel; and if there be no man to deliver us, we will come out to thee.
<BBE> And David said to Abner, Art not thou a man? and who is like to thee in Israel? and why hast thou not guarded thy lord the king? for one of the people came in to destroy the king thy lord.
<BBE> Now Heli was ninety and eight years old, and his eyes were dim, and he could not see.
<BBE> He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, "I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore get her for me as my wife."
<BBE> Then they put the ark of Yahweh on the utility cart with the container holding the gold mice and the images of their tumors.
<BBE> But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.
<BBE> And David took all of the sheep, and the cattle they drove along in front of that livestock, and they said, "This is David's plunder."
<BBE> And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.
<BBE> And Manasseh hath not occupied Beth-Shean and its towns, and Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Iblaim and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, and the Canaanite is desirous to dwell in that land;
<BBE> My heart hath rejoiced in the Lord, and my horn is exalted in my God: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies: because I have joyed in thy salvation.
<BBE> The valiant men ceased, and rested in Israel: until Debbora arose, a mother arose in Israel.
<BBE> And David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
<BBE> According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.
<BBE> And David goeth thence, and is escaped unto the cave of Adullam, and his brethren hear, and all the house of his father, and go down unto him thither;
<BBE> And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he repeated them in the ears of Jehovah.
<BBE> because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.
<BBE> that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that discloseth to me when my son maketh a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or discloseth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
<BBE> And Saul said to his servant, Well said: come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.
<BBE> According to all the deeds that they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.
<BBE> So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, "They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people!"
<BBE> He put his life in his hand and attacked the Philistine, and Yahweh brought about a great victory for all of Israel, and you saw it and rejoiced! Now why should you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?"
<BBE> Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress!"
<BBE> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
<BBE> Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed [of it].
<BBE> that by them I may test Israel, to see if they will keep the Yahweh's way to walk therein, as their fathers kept it, or not."
<BBE> and gather themselves unto him do every man in distress, and every man who hath an exactor, and every man bitter in soul, and he is over them for head, and there are with him about four hundred men.
<BBE> And the children of Israel said unto Jehovah, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; only deliver us, we pray thee, this day.
<BBE> And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.
<BBE> And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
<BBE> As he came up to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him; and the Spirit of Yahweh rushed on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that has burned with fire, and his bindings melted from his hands.
<BBE> And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
<BBE> And he was sore athirst, and called on the Lord, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
<BBE> But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
<BBE> Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he hath broken down his altar.
<BBE> from now on waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet.

<BBE> And the uncle of Saul saith, `Declare, I pray thee, to me, what Samuel said to you?'
<BBE> And Gideon son of Joash turneth back from the battle, at the going up of the sun,
<BBE> And it came to pass, when the Angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice and wept.
<BBE> And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
<BBE> So Yahweh left those nations; he did not drive them out at once, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua.
<BBE> We will take ten men of a hundred out of all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to bring victuals for the army, that we might fight against Gabaa of Benjamin, and render to it for its wickedness, what it deserveth.
<BBE> And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.
<BBE> And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the Lord delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.
<BBE> And Ehud hath come unto him, and he is sitting in the upper chamber of the wall which he hath for himself, and Ehud saith, `A word of God I have unto thee;' and he riseth from off the throne;
<BBE> Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
<BBE> And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
<BBE> And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is before Egypt.
<BBE> After him Jair the Gileadite rose up, and he judged Israel twenty-two years.
<BBE> Therefore also he is able to save completely those who draw near to God through him, because he always lives in order to intercede on their behalf.
<BBE> There is both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, for your servant, and for the young man who is with your servant; there is no lack of anything."
<BBE> but concerning the Son, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of righteous is the scepter of your kingdom.
<BBE> Yahweh has done to you just as he spoke by my hand! Yahweh has torn the kingdom from your hand and has given it to your neighbor, to David.
<BBE> And afterwards they cried to the Lord, who raised them up a saviour called Aod, the son of Gera, the son of Jemini, who used the left hand as well as the right. And the children of Israel sent presents to Eglon king of Moab by him.
<BBE> looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may give trouble, and through this many may be defiled;
<BBE> And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
<BBE> So they ran and took him from there, and when he took his stand among the people, he was taller than all the people from his shoulders and up.
<BBE> and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king's table.
<BBE> For the one about whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe from which no one has officiated at the altar.
<BBE> And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.
<BBE> Barak said to her, "If you go with me, I will go; but if you do not go with me, I will not go."
<BBE> And David having girded his sword upon his armour, began to try if he could walk in armour: for he was not accustomed to it. And David said to Saul: I cannot go thus, for I am not used to it. And he laid them off,
<BBE> And David abode in the wilderness in strongholds, and abode in the mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.
<BBE> And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
<BBE> And now beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat nothing unclean.
<BBE> and having a great priest over the house of God;
<BBE> God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?
<BBE> And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
<BBE> Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death.
<BBE> And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
<BBE> And they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.
<BBE> And Saul said to him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me as a lier-in-wait, as at this day?
<BBE> and if ye are not able to declare  to me, then ye have given to me thirty linen shirts, and thirty changes of garments.' And they say to him, `Put forth thy riddle, and we hear it!'
<BBE> And she said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.
<BBE> Gaal spoke again and said, "Behold, people are coming down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim."
<BBE> And David abode with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household; David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jizreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
<BBE> And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four hundred young women that were virgins, who had known no man by lying with any male, and they brought them to the camp, to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
<BBE> taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they.
<BBE> And Samuel said: When thou wast a little one in thy own eyes, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the Lord anointed thee to be king over Israel.
<BBE> And Jehovah said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
<BBE> that Jehovah sent a prophet unto the children of Israel: and he said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
<BBE> And Saul took him that day, and would not let him return to his father's house.
<BBE> but *ye* have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your troubles, and have said unto him, [Nay,] but a king shalt thou set over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.
<BBE> Then David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled.
<BBE> For it is borne witness, *Thou* art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.
<BBE> Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
<BBE> And she saith, `Let thy handmaid find grace in thine eyes;' and the woman goeth on her way, and eateth, and her countenance hath not been  for it any more.
<BBE> And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the Angel of God came again to the woman whilst she sat in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her.
<BBE> And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
<BBE> Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord.
<BBE> And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the utensils of service with the blood.
<BBE> (Now her rival wife would provoke her severely in order to upset her because Yahweh had closed her womb.)
<BBE> The boy left, and then David got up from the south side, and he fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together, but David wept the most.
<BBE> And he said to them: Why do ye these kinds of things, which I hear, very wicked things, from all the people?
<BBE> And again, I will trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children which God has given me.
<BBE> Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
<BBE> each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.
<BBE> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
<BBE> While they were enjoying themselves, behold, the men of the city, the perverse lot, surrounded the house, pounding on the door. And they said to the old man, the owner of the house, "Bring out the man who came to your house so that we may have sex with him."
<BBE> They said to the messengers who had come, "Thus you will say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: 'Tomorrow deliverance for you will come when the sun is hot.'" When the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced.
<BBE> For indeed he was sick, coming near to death, but God had mercy on him and not on him only, but also on me, so that I would not have grief upon grief.
<BBE> And Joshua son of Nun, servant of Jehovah, dieth, a son of a hundred and ten years,
<BBE> Naphtali did not dispossess the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; and he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries to them.
<BBE> When therefore these signs shall happen to thee, do whatsoever thy hand shall find, for the Lord is with thee.
<BBE> But when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. And the children of Israel sent tribute by him unto Eglon the king of Moab.
<BBE> And it came to pass, as she multiplied prayers before the Lord, that Heli observed her mouth.
<BBE> And the Lord visited Anna, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters: and the child Samuel became great before the Lord.
<BBE> because God had provided something better for us, so that they would not be made perfect without us.
<BBE> For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.
<BBE> And he smote them from Aroer till you come to Mennith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel, which is set with vineyards, with a very great slaughter: and the children of Ammon were humbled by the children of Israel.
<BBE> and they declare  to Jotham, and he goeth and standeth on the top of mount Gerizim, and lifteth up his voice, and calleth, and saith to them, `Hearken unto me, O masters of Shechem, and God doth hearken unto you:
<BBE> and Benjamin turneth back at that time, and they give to them the women whom they have kept alive of the women of Jabesh-Gilead, and they have not found for [all of] them so.
<BBE> And David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will give the Philistines into thy hand.
<BBE> Hills flowed from the face of Jehovah, This one -- Sinai -- From the face of Jehovah, God of Israel.
<BBE> Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
<BBE> And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, and go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. And the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
<BBE> nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,
<BBE> Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you. Yahweh shall rule over you."
<BBE> And Saul said to them, "May you be blessed by Yahweh, for you have shown me compassion!
<BBE> Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds have now been with us, and we didn't harm them, neither was there anything missing from them, all the while they were in Carmel.
<BBE> He will take your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, even their best, and give them to his servants.
<BBE> For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
<BBE> And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
<BBE> When Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, they told him, "Look, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi."
<BBE> And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
<BBE> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.
<BBE> Now therefore listen to their voice. However you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the way of the king who will reign over them."
<BBE> You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows."
<BBE> Yahweh kills and restores alive, he brings down to Sheol and raises up.
<BBE> But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
<BBE> By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the going out of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
<BBE> by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
<BBE> And Elkanah goeth to Ramath, unto his house, and the youth hath been serving Jehovah,  the presence of Eli the priest;
<BBE> Fear not: for the hand of my father Saul shall not find thee, and thou shalt reign over Israel, and I shall be next to thee, yea, and my father knoweth this.
<BBE> So David said to Abner, "Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why did you not keep watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy your lord the king.
<BBE> But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah has sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah has appointed him ruler over his people; for thou hast not kept what Jehovah commanded thee.
<BBE> So then, go and attack Amalek and utterly destroy all that is his! You must not spare him, but kill both man and woman, both child and nursing infant, both ox and sheep, both camel and donkey.'"
<BBE> And all the Israelites when they saw the man, fled from his face, fearing him exceedingly.
<BBE> And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." And he pushed with all his strength, and the house fell on the rulers and all of the people who were with him. And the dead whom he killed in his death were more than those he killed in his life.
<BBE> Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
<BBE> For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number; and they entered into the land to destroy it.
<BBE> Not yet unto blood did ye resist -- with the sin striving;
<BBE> And they set up to themselves the graven idol, and Jonathan the son of Gersam the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests in the tribe of Dan, until the day of their captivity.
<BBE> But Saul said, "No one will be put to death on this day, because today Yahweh has provided deliverance in Israel."
<BBE> And these ten portions of cheese you will bring to the commander of the thousand; find out how your brothers are doing, and take their pledge."
<BBE> Now indeed even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.
<BBE> But without faith it is impossible to please God. For he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and is a rewarder to them that seek him.
<BBE> For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
<BBE> And as to the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;
<BBE> And the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; and Israel was greatly distressed.
<BBE> So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck; for the men of Israel yielded to Benjamin, because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.
<BBE> And David saith to Abigail, `Blessed  Jehovah, God of Israel, who hath sent thee this day to meet me,
<BBE> And Samuel said: What meaneth then this bleating of the flocks, which soundeth in my ears, and the lowing of the herds, which I hear?
<BBE> And now, hearken to their voice; only, surely thou dost certainly protest to them, and hast declared to them the custom of the king who doth reign over them.'
<BBE> And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.

<BBE> And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
<BBE> And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.
<BBE> For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.
<BBE> And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
<BBE> Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
<BBE> They answered him: The Lord who heareth these things, he himself is mediator and witness that we will do as we have promised.
<BBE> And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.
<BBE> And David and his men came to the city, and behold, it was burnt with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters were taken captives.
<BBE> And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
<BBE> And then on the next day, the second day of the new moon, that David's place was empty. So Saul asked Jonathan his son, "Why did the son of Jesse not come either yesterday or today to the feast?"
<BBE> And he said to them, "Follow after me! Yahweh has given Moab your enemies into your hand." So they went down after him, and they captured the fords of the Jordan toward Moab; and they did not allow anyone to cross over.
<BBE> And he giveth back the eleven hundred silverlings to his mother, and his mother saith, `I had certainly sanctified the silver to Jehovah, from my hand, for my son, to make a graven image, and a molten image; and now, I give it back to thee.'
<BBE> (To whom it was said: In Isaac shall thy seed be called.)
<BBE> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
<BBE> And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said to you.
<BBE> Why then didst thou not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, but didst fall upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of Jehovah?
<BBE> And when they were come in, he saw Eliab, and said: Is the Lord's anointed before him?
<BBE> Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.

<BBE> And he inquired of Jehovah for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
<BBE> And it is still more clear, if another priest according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises,
<BBE> Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
<BBE> But Zebee and Salmana were resting with all their army. For fifteen thousand men were left of all the troops of the eastern people, and one hundred and twenty thousand warriors that drew the sword, were slain.
<BBE> And Saul said to his servants: Provide me then some man that can play well, and bring him to me.
<BBE> And Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened to your voice in all that ye said to me, and have made a king over you.
<BBE> And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel; and Jehovah was with them.
<BBE> But his wife said unto him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.
<BBE> So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before Jehovah, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
<BBE> So David got up and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, the king of Gath.
<BBE> Above, saying Sacrifices and offerings and burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou willedst not, neither tookest pleasure in (which are offered according to the law);
<BBE> Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.
<BBE> And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before Jehovah.
<BBE> They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, and drank no water for three days and three nights.
<BBE> also to appoint for himself heads of thousands, and heads of fifties; also to plow his plowing, and to reap his reaping; and to make instruments of his war, and instruments of his charioteer.

<BBE> And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered together their armies for warfare to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, Know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me to the camp, thou and thy men.
<BBE> I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
<BBE> Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is so that Yahweh has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering. But if it is the children of men, they are cursed before Yahweh; for they have driven me out today that I shouldn't cling to Yahweh's inheritance, saying, 'Go, serve other gods!'
<BBE> Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
<BBE> And Samson goeth down -- also his father and his mother, to Timnath, and they come unto the vineyards of Timnath, and lo, a lion's whelp roareth at meeting him,
<BBE> And his father and his mother said to him, Is there no woman among the daughters of thy brethren, and among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the Philistines, the uncircumcised? And Samson said to his father, Take her for me, for she pleases me well.
<BBE> And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
<BBE> And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
<BBE> And David said to Achish, If now I have found favour in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some country-town, that I may abide there; for why should thy servant abide in the royal city with thee?
<BBE> Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them.
<BBE> And there was a certain man of Zoreah, of the family of the Danites, and his name was Manoah. And his wife was barren and did not bear.
<BBE> For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
<BBE> And on the morrow the Philistines came to strip the slain, and they found Saul and his three sons lying in mount Gelboe.
<BBE> Jehovah therefore shall be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and do me justice [in delivering me] out of thy hand.
<BBE> And David saith, `Jehovah liveth; except Jehovah doth smite him, or his day come that he hath died, or into battle he go down, and hath been consumed --
<BBE> not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in  day of my taking their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because *they* did not continue in my covenant, and *I* did not regard them, saith  Lord.
<BBE> there salute you all the saints, and specially those of Caesar's house;
<BBE> And the woman cometh in unto Saul, and seeth that he hath been greatly troubled, and saith unto him, `Lo, thy maid-servant hath hearkened to thy voice, and I put my soul in my hand, and I obey thy words which thou hast spoken unto me;
<BBE> And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.

<BBE> When he had set the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.
<BBE> Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon's house, step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day.
<BBE> In due time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She called his name Samuel, for she said, "I requested him from Yahweh."
<BBE> And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed because they saw that disaster was closing in on them.
<BBE> Saul was in the thick of the battle, and the archers spotted him, and he was badly wounded by the archers.
<BBE> And Saul said, God do so [to me] and more also; thou shalt certainly die, Jonathan.
<BBE> And there riseth after him Jair the Gileadite, and he judgeth Israel twenty and two years,
<BBE> And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed peace-offerings before Jehovah. And there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced exceedingly.
<BBE> considering reproach endured for the sake of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.
<BBE> And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
<BBE> And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?
<BBE> And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
<BBE> But at the time Saul's daughter Merab was to be given to David, she was given instead to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.
<BBE> And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
<BBE> The princes of Issachar were with Deborah. As was Issachar, so was Barak. They rushed into the valley at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben, there were great resolves of heart.
<BBE> Therefore welcome him in the Lord with all joy, and consider such people highly honored,
<BBE> I will make him know that I am about to judge his household forever because of the iniquity that he knew, for his sons were bringing curses on themselves, but he did not rebuke them.
<BBE> Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and the flesh of my cattle, which I have killed for my shearers, and give to men whom I know not whence they are?
<BBE> And told him that Saul had slain the priests of the Lord.
<BBE> Marriage must be held in honor by all, and the marriage bed be undefiled, because God will judge sexually immoral people and adulterers.
<BBE> I said, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to Jehovah; and I forced myself, and offered up the burnt-offering.
<BBE> Whence shall they take wives? For we have all in general sworn, not to give our daughters to them.
<BBE> For consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself, that ye be not weary, fainting in your minds.
<BBE> And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
<BBE> And Abimelech riseth, and all the people who  with him, by night, and they lay wait against Shechem -- four detachments;

<BBE> And the Philistine draweth nigh, morning and evening, and stationeth himself forty days.
<BBE> And Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel: and two thousand were with Saul in Machmas, and in mount Bethel: and a thousand with Jonathan in Gabaa of Benjamin, and the rest of the people he sent back every man to their dwellings.
<BBE> we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace -- for seasonable help.
<BBE> The Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and they served the Baals.
<BBE> And the children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.
<BBE> And his father went down to the woman, and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
<BBE> Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
<BBE> And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men.
<BBE> And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
<BBE> Will the men of Ceila deliver me into his hands? and will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Lord God of Israel, tell thy servant. And the Lord said: He will come down.
<BBE> and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and will speak of thee with my father: and see what it is, and tell thee.
<BBE> Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and, lo, I must die.
<BBE> Have moreover tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
<BBE> When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
<BBE> Gilead abode beyond the Jordan: And Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, And abode by his creeks.
<BBE> thus also Christ, having been offered once in order to bear the sins of many, will appear for the second time without reference to sin to those who eagerly await him for salvation.
<BBE> who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,
<BBE> When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, "May you be blessed by Yahweh! I have kept the word of Yahweh."
<BBE> So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you bring me back to fight against the Ammonites, and Yahweh gives them over to me, will I be your head?"
<BBE> and one in a certain place did testify fully, saying, `What is man, that Thou art mindful of him, or a son of man, that Thou dost look after him?
<BBE> And the people repented concerning Benjamin, for Jehovah had made a breach among the tribes of Israel.
<BBE> Naphtali hath not dispossessed the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh, and the inhabitants of Beth-Anath, and he dwelleth in the midst of the Canaanite, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh and of Beth-Anath have become tributary to them.
<BBE> David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
<BBE> equip you with every good thing to do his will, carrying out in us what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever. Amen.
<BBE> And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
<BBE> Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,
<BBE> For if a man at any time shall rise, and persecute thee, and seek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be kept, as in the bundle of the living, with the Lord thy God: but the souls of thy enemies shall be whirled, as with the violence and whirling of a sling.
<BBE> that they say to him, `Say, I pray thee, Shibboleth;' and he saith, `Sibboleth,' and is not prepared to speak right -- and they seize him, and slaughter him at the passages of the Jordan, and there fall at that time, of Ephraim, forty and two chiefs.
<BBE> They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.
<BBE> When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, "Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us, into our hand."
<BBE> and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath blessed,
<BBE> And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, which knew not Jehovah, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.
<BBE> Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?
<BBE> and David sendeth spies, and knoweth that Saul hath come unto Nachon,
<BBE> And if they say thus, Come up to us, then we will go up; for Jehovah has given them into our hand; and this shall be the sign to us.
<BBE> Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we have heard, lest perhaps we should let them slip.
<BBE> Grace be with you all. Amen.
<BBE> And Jehovah said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the people go every man unto his place.

<BBE> When he had come, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them.
<BBE> and now, bear, I pray thee, with my sin, and turn back with me, and I bow myself to Jehovah.'
<BBE> So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And the liers-in-wait were abiding in the inner chamber. And he brake them off his arms like a thread.
<BBE> Then the Israelites said to Samuel, "You must not cease from crying out to Yahweh our God, so that he will deliver us from the hand of the Philistines."
<BBE> And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.

<BBE> He went from year to year in a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.
<BBE> Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.
<BBE> Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul smote his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
<BBE> David answered, "Behold the spear, O king! Then let one of the young men come over and get it.
<BBE> And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made sport before them. And they set him between the pillars:
<BBE> `And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorite from the presence of His people Israel, and thou wouldst possess it!
<BBE> For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
<BBE> so that it became evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;
<BBE> But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior for them, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.
<BBE> And a man from there responded and said, "And who is their father?" Therefore it became a proverb: "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
<BBE> and it cometh to pass, when Israel hath been strong, that he setteth the Canaanite to tribute, and hath not utterly dispossessed it.
<BBE> They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim, saying, "The Philistines have brought back Yahweh's ark. Come down, and bring it up to yourselves."
<BBE> But whatever things were gain to me, these things I have considered loss because of Christ.
<BBE> These are the nations which the Lord left, that by them he might instruct Israel, and all that had not known the wars of the Chanaanites:
<BBE> And Yahweh turned to him and said, "Go in this your strength, and you will deliver Israel from the palm of Midian. Did I not send you?"
<BBE> Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.
<BBE> And Saul said to Samuel: Yea I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord, and have walked in the way by which the Lord sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalec, and Amalec I have slain.
<BBE> And Jehovah appeared again at Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.
<BBE> After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead dog, after a flea.
<BBE> And Jehovah smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjaminites that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men: all these drew the sword.
<BBE> Deal kindly then with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee; but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
<BBE> Jonathan gave his weapons to his servant and said to him, "Go, bring them to the city."
<BBE> And David said to Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would certainly tell Saul: I am accountable for all the lives of thy father's house.
<BBE> and the men of Judah say, `Why have ye come up against us?' and they say, `To bind Samson we have come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.'
<BBE> Look, all you Israelites! Make your decision and advice here."
<BBE> And the king saith, `Thou dost surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all the house of thy father.'
<BBE> Do nothing according to selfish ambition or according to empty conceit, but in humility considering one another better than yourselves,
<BBE> and, now, I have heard that thou hast shearers; now, the shepherds whom thou hast have been with us, we have not put them to shame, nor hath anything been looked after by them, all the days of their being in Carmel.
<BBE> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
<BBE> The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh's sight, and served the Baals.
<BBE> And the children of Dan set up the graven image; and Jehonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses; he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
<BBE> And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was of about twenty men, within half an acre of land, which a yoke of oxen is wont to plough in a day.
<BBE> And Saul said to his uncle: He told us that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel had spoken to him, he told him not.
<BBE> Thou tookest no pleasure in burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin.
<BBE> Blessed above women is Jael, Wife of Heber the Kenite, Above women in the tent she is blessed.
<BBE> And Samson saith unto her, `If they bind me with seven green withs which have not been dried, then I have been weak, and have been as one of the human race.'
<BBE> And they that were slain in the same place were eighteen thousand men, all most valiant soldiers.
<BBE> Behold; if it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then he has done us this great evil; but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us. It was a chance that happened to us."
<BBE> And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, Ye had not found out my riddle.
<BBE> And it cometh to pass in her coming in, that she persuadeth him to ask from her father the field, and she lighteth from off the ass, and Caleb saith to her, `What -- to thee?'
<BBE> Therefore, since the children share in blood and flesh, he also in like manner shared in these same things, in order that through death he could destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,
<BBE> And the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, and said, What is the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah had come into the camp.
<BBE> And Manoah saith, `Now let thy words come to pass; what is the custom of the youth -- and his work?'
<BBE> And the cities which the Philistines have taken from Israel are restored to Israel -- from Ekron even unto Gath -- and their border hath Israel delivered out of the hand of the Philistines; and there is peace between Israel and the Amorite.
<BBE> And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites the children of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
<BBE> And David said to Achimelech: Hast thou here at hand a spear, or a sword? for I brought not my own sword, nor my own weapons with me, for the king's business required haste.
<BBE> Therefore they said: Who is thereof all the tribes of Israel, that came not up to the Lord to Maspha. And behold the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad were found not to have been in that army.

<BBE> And there is a certain man of Ramathaim-Zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name  Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, and Ephrathite,
<BBE> "Don't keep talking so exceedingly proudly. Don't let arrogance come out of your mouth, For Yahweh is a God of knowledge. By him actions are weighed.
<BBE> a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord set up, not man.
<BBE> And the boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was rare in those days; a vision was not frequent.
<BBE> Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord: for men abhorred the offering of the Lord.
<BBE> So that, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, thus stand fast in  Lord, beloved.
<BBE> And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.
<BBE> You will roll them up like a mantle, and they will be changed; but you are the same. Your years will not fail."
<BBE> And it came to pass, when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the south, and upon Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag and burned it with fire;
<BBE> And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, on his chariot and among his horsemen, and they shall run before his chariots;
<BBE> I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.
<BBE> And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
<BBE> Jonathan stripped off the robe that he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his fighting attire, and even his sword, his bow, and his belt.
<BBE> David said to Saul, "Let no man's heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
<BBE> And Achish believeth in David, saying, `He hath made himself utterly abhorred among his people, in Israel, and hath been to me for a servant age-during.'
<BBE> And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
<BBE> And the men of the tribe of Juda said to them: Why are you come up against us? They answered: We are come to bind Samson, and to pay him for what he hath done against us.
<BBE> Jephthah said to them, "I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you didn't save me out of their hand.
<BBE> And Samuel hath died, and all Israel mourn for him, and bury him in Ramah, even in his city, and Saul hath turned aside those having familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
<BBE> David came to Saul, and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.

<BBE> who is faithful to him that has constituted him, as Moses also in all his house.
<BBE> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
<BBE> The former proclaim Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction in my imprisonment.
<BBE> And when they that remained of Benjamin saw this, they fled into the wilderness and made towards the rock that is called Remmon. In that flight, also as they were straggling and going different ways, they slew of them five thousand men. And as they went farther, they still pursued them, and slew also other two thousand.

<BBE> For Jehovah will not cast away his people for his great name's sake; because it has pleased Jehovah to make you his people.

<BBE> When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, "Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! He will have authority over my people."
<BBE> with teachings manifold and strange be not carried about, for [it is] good that by grace the heart be confirmed, not with meats, in which they who were occupied were not profited;
<BBE> David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
<BBE> For he didn't subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels.
<BBE> and the Philistines called to the priests and to those who practiced divination, saying, "What should we do with the ark of Yahweh? Inform us how we should send it to its place."
<BBE> And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
<BBE> Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
<BBE> They said, "What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn't come up to Yahweh to Mizpah?" Behold, no one came from Jabesh Gilead to the camp to the assembly.
<BBE> for if the blood of bulls, and goats, and ashes of an heifer, sprinkling those defiled, doth sanctify to the purifying of the flesh,
<BBE> And Achis said to him: Whom hast thou gone against to day? David answered: Against the south of Juda, and against the south of Jerameel, and against the south of Ceni.
<BBE> They said to him, "We have come down to bind you and give you over into the hand of the Philistines." And Samson said to them, "Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves."
<BBE> And Gideon said to them, I would desire a request of you: give me every man the earrings of his booty; for they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.
<BBE> Kings came,—they fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan; At Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; They took no spoil of silver.
<BBE> But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: [we go] by lot against it;
<BBE> Take not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my grief and provocation have I spoken hitherto.
<BBE> If I shall say to the boy: Behold the arrows are on this side of thee, take them up: come thou to me, because, there is peace to thee, and there is no evil, as the Lord liveth. But if I shall speak thus to the boy: Behold the arrows are beyond thee: go in peace, for the Lord hath sent thee away.
<BBE> And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
<BBE> And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
<BBE> and like a robe you will roll them up, and like a garment they will be changed; but you are the same, and your years will not run out."
<BBE> And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
<BBE> Then David said, "O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
<BBE> For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,"
<BBE> And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,
<BBE> Between her feet he bowed -- He fell, he lay down; Between her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell -- destroyed.
<BBE> But David fled from Najoth, which is in Ramatha, and came and said to Jonathan: What have I done? what is my iniquity, and what is my sin against thy father, that he seeketh my life?
<BBE> So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted unto the liers-in-wait whom they had set against Gibeah.
<BBE> And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us; for after he hath said,
<BBE> So Gedeon went in, and boiled a kid, and made unleavened loaves of a measure of flour: and putting the flesh in a basket, and the broth of the flesh into a pot, he carried all under the oak, and presented to him.
<BBE> Then Samuel got up and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul mustered the people who were found with him, about six hundred men.
<BBE> And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
<BBE> For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
<BBE> and the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn't draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.
<BBE> And the thorn-bush said to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, come, put confidence in my shadow; but if not, fire shall come out of the thorn-bush and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
<BBE> Let our lord give orders, and thy servants who are before thee will seek out a man skillful in playing on the harp, that when the evil spirit from the Lord is upon thee, he may play with his hand, and thou mayest bear it more easily.
<BBE> And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
<BBE> Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him.
<BBE> But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, "Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For with what should this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Should it not be with the heads of these men?
<BBE> Consequently a sabbath rest remains for the people of God.
<BBE> And Samson lay till midnight; and he arose at midnight, and seized the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and tore them up with the bar, and put  upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.
<BBE> And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.
<BBE> Here I am. Witness against me before Yahweh, and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Of whose hand have I taken a ransom to make me blind my eyes? I will restore it to you."
<BBE> And the Philistines are humbled, and have not added any more to come into the border of Israel, and the hand of Jehovah is on the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
<BBE> and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ  Lord to God  Father's glory.
<BBE> And Barac said to her: If thou wilt come with me, I will go: if thou wilt not come with me, I will not go.
<BBE> And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
<BBE> He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and those to do his plowing and to reap his harvest, and those to make weapons of war and the equipment for his chariots.
<BBE> And Gideon realized that he was the angel of Yahweh; and Gideon said, "Oh, my lord Yahweh! For now I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face."
<BBE> all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
<BBE> for, in that himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those that are being tempted.
<BBE> And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:
<BBE> And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.
<BBE> I have known both to be abased, and I have known to abound; in everything and in all things I have been initiated, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.
<BBE> Your servant struck both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God."
<BBE> And David saith to Ahimelech the priest, `The king hath commanded me a matter, and he saith unto me, Let no man know anything of the matter about which I am sending thee, and which I have commanded thee; and the young men I have caused to know at such and such a place;
<BBE> as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies  his footstool,
<BBE> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.
<BBE> And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
<BBE> for those saying such things make manifest that they seek a country;
<BBE> And the men of Shechem set liers-in-wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
<BBE> And afterwards they went down and fought against the Chanaanite, who dwelt in the mountains, and in the south, and in the plains.
<BBE> And he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, and give to his chamberlains and to his servants.
<BBE> but you shall also not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when Yahweh has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the surface of the earth."
<BBE> and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovah's, and he will give you into our hand.
<BBE> But the God of peace, who brought again from among  dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, in [the power of the] blood of  eternal covenant,
<BBE> And the children of Ammon were called together and encamped in Gilead; and the children of Israel gathered together and encamped in Mizpeh.
<BBE> not like the covenant which I made with their fathers on the day I took hold of them by my hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant and I disregarded them, says the Lord.
<BBE> And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.
<BBE> And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore we have returned to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be head over all of us the inhabitants of Gilead.
<BBE> Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, "Do you come peaceably?"
<BBE> and now, what is there under thy hand? five loaves give into my hand, or that which is found.'
<BBE> And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of Jehovah: I have performed the commandment of Jehovah.
<BBE> For we -- willfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth -- no more for sins doth there remain a sacrifice,
<BBE> And I -- I have not sinned against thee, and thou art doing with me evil -- to fight against me. Jehovah, the Judge, doth judge to-day between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.'
<BBE> But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.
<BBE> then he said, Lo, I come to do thy will. He takes away the first that he may establish the second;
<BBE> And God doth so on that night, and there is drought on the fleece alone, and on all the earth there hath been dew.
<BBE> For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.
<BBE> Then the troops took the plunder: they took sheep and cattle and calves and slaughtered them on the ground and the troops ate them all with the blood.
<BBE> And the men of the city say to him on the seventh day, before the sun goeth in: -- `What  sweeter than honey? And what stronger than a lion?' And he saith to them: `Unless ye had ploughed with my heifer, Ye had not found out my riddle.'
<BBE> So he took a yoke of oxen and cut them into pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, "Whoever is not going out after Saul and after Samuel, so will it be done to his oxen." Then the fear of Yahweh fell on the people and they went out as one man.
<BBE> and Sisera calleth all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who  with him, from Harosheth of the Goyim, unto the brook Kishon.
<BBE> However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
<BBE> Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take plunder among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them." They said, "Do whatever seems good to you." Then the priest said, "Let us draw near here to God."
<BBE> And the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed); and the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in cliffs, and in strongholds, and in pits.
<BBE> But after the judge was dead, they returned, and did much worse things than their fathers had done, following strange gods, serving them and adoring them. They left not their own inventions, and the stubborn way, by which they were accustomed to walk.
<BBE> And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.
<BBE> And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
<BBE> But one has somewhere testified, saying, "What is man, that you think of him? Or the son of man, that you care for him?
<BBE> Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them.
<BBE> For we made an invasion on the south side of Cerethi, and upon Juda, and upon the south of Caleb, and we burnt Siceleg with fire.
<BBE> I will place a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and all of the ground is dry, I will know that you will deliver Israel by my hand, just as you have said."
<BBE> Then Samuel taking Saul and his servant, brought them into the parlour, and gave them a place at the head of them that were invited. For there were about thirty men.
<BBE> and the men that died not were smitten with the hemorrhoids; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
<BBE> Now Jehovah had apprised Samuel one day before Saul came, saying,
<BBE> And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto Jehovah.
<BBE> Also before they make perfume with the fat -- then hath the priest's servant come in, and said to the man who is sacrificing, `Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he doth not take of thee flesh boiled, but raw;'
<BBE> Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.
<BBE> And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear, and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.
<BBE> And the thing is evil in the eyes of Samuel, when they have said, `Give to us a king to judge us;' and Samuel prayeth unto Jehovah.
<BBE> but what things were gain to me these I counted, on account of Christ, loss.
<BBE> And Saul saith unto his servants, `Provide, I pray you, for me a man playing well -- then ye have brought  in unto me.'
<BBE> When I saw that you didn't save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me today, to fight against me?"
<BBE> But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.
<BBE> The woman bore a son, and she called him Samson; the boy grew big, and Yahweh blessed him.
<BBE> After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
<BBE> In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.
<BBE> So the king said to the runners who were stationed around him, "Turn and kill the priests of Yahweh, because they also support David and because they knew that he was fleeing and did not disclose it to me." But the servants of the king were not willing to raise their hand to attack the priests of Yahweh.
<BBE> And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
<BBE> Let our lord now speak; thy servants are before thee: they shall seek out a man, a skilful player on a harp; and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
<BBE> And Jonathan said to David, Come and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
<BBE> When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each one went to his home.
<BBE> He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, put out his hand, took it, and struck a thousand men with it.
<BBE> Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
<BBE> And the six hundred men took the priest, and the things we spoke of before, and came to Lais to a people that was quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword: and the city was burnt with fire,
<BBE> And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
<BBE> and Gideon maketh it into an ephod, and setteth it up in his city, in Ophrah, and all Israel go a-whoring after it there, and it is to Gideon and to his house for a snare.
<BBE> For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.
<BBE> And they say, `We certainly give;' and they spread out the garment, and cast thither each the ring of his prey;
<BBE> Stay with me! Do not fear, because he who seeks my life seeks your life. You are in good care with me."
<BBE> When they were coming back after David had returned from striking down the Philistine, the women went out from all the cities of Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul with tambourines, with joy, and with three-stringed instruments.
<BBE> And Yahweh said to Gideon, "I will deliver you with the three hundred men lapping up the water; I will give Midian into your hand, so let the other troops go, each to his own place.
<BBE> And he said unto them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they said, He is witness.
<BBE> By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
<BBE> For I have no one like-minded who will sincerely be concerned about your circumstances.
<BBE> though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.
<BBE> And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
<BBE> For by it the elders obtained a good report.
<BBE> And the princes of Galaad said to Jephte: For this cause we are now come to thee, that thou mayst go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be head over all the inhabitants of Galaad.
<BBE> The woman had a fattened calf in the house. She hurried and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.
<BBE> So he brought him to his house, and he fed the donkeys; they washed their feet, ate, and drank.
<BBE> So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him.
<BBE> He made a vow to the Lord, saying: If thou wilt deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,
<BBE> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baals.
<BBE> and Ahiah, son of Ahitub, brother of I-Chabod, son of Phinehas son of Eli priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, bearing an ephod; and the people knew not that Jonathan hath gone.
<BBE> And the young man arose to set forward with his wife and servant. And his father in law spoke to him again: Consider that the day is declining, and draweth toward evening: tarry with me to day also, and spend the day in mirth, and to morrow thou shalt depart, that thou mayest go into thy house.
<BBE> They got up early, and as dawn was breaking, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, "Get up, so that I can send you away." So Saul got up and the two of them, he and Samuel, went outside.
<BBE> And David riseth, and passeth over, he and six hundred men who  with him, unto Achish son of Maoch king of Gath;
<BBE> Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
<BBE> Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.
<BBE> My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless Jehovah!
<BBE> so I swore in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest.
<BBE> For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
<BBE> Samuel said, "Even though you are small in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh has anointed you as king over Israel.
<BBE> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
<BBE> This day will Jehovah deliver thee up into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the camp of the Philistines this day to the fowl of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth. And all the earth shall know that Israel has a God;
<BBE> Therefore let us also, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
<BBE> And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
<BBE> No, my sons, for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah's people transgress.
<BBE> constantly in my every supplication, making the supplication for you all with joy,
<BBE> And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
<BBE> and the haft also goeth in after the blade, and the fat shutteth on the blade, that he hath not drawn the sword out of his belly, and it goeth out at the fundament.
<BBE> And all Israel was very sorry, and repented for the destroying of one tribe out of Israel.
<BBE> and this I pray, that your love yet more and more may abound in full knowledge, and all judgment,
<BBE> For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
<BBE> And Christ being come, chief priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands -- that is, not of this creation --
<BBE> And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
<BBE> And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
<BBE> Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.
<BBE> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
<BBE> Saul said to his uncle, "He told us plainly that the donkeys were found." But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn't tell him.
<BBE> Go and cry to the gods that ye have chosen: let them save you in the time of your trouble.
<BBE> and they take captive the women who  in it; from small unto great they have not put any one to death, and they lead away, and go on their way.
<BBE> each not to your own look ye, but each also to the things of others.
<BBE> And the congregation sent there twelve thousand men from the troops, and they commanded them, saying, "Go, strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, and the women and children.
<BBE> And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Jehovah will work for us; for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.
<BBE> And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.
<BBE> And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
<BBE> Do not therefore lose your confidence, which hath a great reward.
<BBE> It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
<BBE> I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord.
<BBE> Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou huntest after my life to take it.
<BBE> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<BBE> And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and again destroyed to the ground of the children of Israel eighteen thousand men: all these drew the sword.
<BBE> All the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar. Then the ambushers of Israel broke out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba.
<BBE> And they went up into the city. As they were coming into the midst of the city, behold, Samuel was coming out towards them, to go up to the high place.
<BBE> And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.
<BBE> And he said to her, "Stand at the doorway of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks you, and says, 'Is there anyone here?' You must answer, 'No.'"
<BBE> These all died in faith without receiving the promises, but seeing them from a distance and welcoming them, and admitting that they were strangers and temporary residents on the earth.
<BBE> But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.
<BBE> and he hath forty sons, and thirty grandsons, riding on seventy ass-colts, and he judgeth Israel eight years.
<BBE> Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
<BBE> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
<BBE> Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
<BBE> But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore its name was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi, to this day.
<BBE> But on the fourth day arising early in the morning he desired to depart. But his father in law kept him, and said to him: Taste first a little bread, and strengthen thy stomach, and so thou shalt depart.
<BBE> And his concubine, that he had in Sichem, bore him a son, whose name was Abimelech.
<BBE> And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.
<BBE> And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.

<BBE> When David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.

<BBE> and Saul seeth that he is acting very wisely, and is afraid of him,
<BBE> and Sihon hath not trusted Israel to pass over through his border, and Sihon gathereth all his people, and they encamp in Jahaz, and fight with Israel;

<BBE> And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee.
<BBE> And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Lord smote Nabal, that he died.

<BBE> And Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk; (now Eli the priest sat upon the seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah;)

<BBE> Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, "Yahweh has not chosen these."

<BBE> Yahweh called yet again, "Samuel!" Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am; for you called me." He answered, "I didn't call, my son. Lie down again."
<BBE> And Saul clothed David with his garments, and put a helmet of brass upon his head, and armed him with a coat of mail.
<BBE> 'Curse Meroz,' said Yahweh's angel. 'Curse bitterly its inhabitants, because they didn't come to help Yahweh, to help Yahweh against the mighty.'

<BBE> Gideon said to God, "Don't let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Please let me make a trial just this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew."
<BBE> and he sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem, and behold, they shut up the city against thee;
<BBE> He had thirty sons. He gave his thirty daughters away in marriage outside his clan and brought in from outside thirty young women for his sons. He judged Israel for seven years.

<BBE> And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
<BBE> And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
<BBE> But no chastening at the time seems to be  of joy, but of grief; but afterwards yields  peaceful fruit of righteousness to those exercised by it.

<BBE> Will the citizens of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? Jehovah, God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down.
<BBE> And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.

<BBE> And they said, "Look, the annual feast of Yahweh is in Shiloh, which is to the north of Bethel, east of the main road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.
<BBE> And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field.
<BBE> Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will shew ourselves to them.
<BBE> And Saul saith, `Draw ye nigh hither all, the chiefs of the people, and know and see in what this sin hath been to-day;
<BBE> After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. He also saved Israel.

<BBE> For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you will not be established, nor will your kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die!"
<BBE> And David riseth early in the morning, and leaveth the flock to a keeper, and lifteth up, and goeth, as Jesse commanded him, and he cometh in to the path, and to the force which is going out unto the rank, and they have shouted for battle;
<BBE> for men indeed do swear by the greater, and an end of all controversy to them for confirmation  the oath,
<BBE> So he said to them, "Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed one is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand." Then they said, "He is witness."
<BBE> But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings;

<BBE> And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

<BBE> Samuel also said unto Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord.
<BBE> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holies, every year with the blood of others:
<BBE> He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cave in Etam's rock.
<BBE> That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
<BBE> And as she was riding on the ass, and coming down by the covert of the hill, behold, David and his men came down opposite to her; and she met them.
<BBE> David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to men's words, saying, 'Behold, David seeks to harm you?'
<BBE> who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.
<BBE> wherefore it did behove him in all things to be made like to the brethren, that he might become a kind and stedfast chief-priest in the things with God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people,

<BBE> And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.
<BBE> Be ye followers of me, brethren, and observe them who walk so as you have our model.
<BBE> As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines came near to battle against Israel; but Yahweh thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and confused them; and they were struck down before Israel.

<BBE> And the Lord hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:
<BBE> And David prevailed over the Philistine, with a sling and a stone, and he struck, and slew the Philistine. And as David had no sword in his hand,
<BBE> And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.
<BBE> And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
<BBE> And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.

<BBE> And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh unto us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.
<BBE> For the law, having a shadow of the coming good things, not the image itself of the things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually yearly, perfect those who approach.

<BBE> The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;
<BBE> And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.

<BBE> But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this.

<BBE> And the sons of Judah fight against Jerusalem, and capture it, and smite it by the mouth of the sword, and the city they have sent into fire;
<BBE> And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place.
<BBE> Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua; the names of his two daughters were as follows: the name of the firstborn was Merab and the younger was Michal.
<BBE> And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
<BBE> And David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and killed him completely, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they fled.
<BBE> Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.
<BBE> And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:
<BBE> and Ehud putteth forth his left hand, and taketh the sword from off his right thigh, and striketh it into his belly;
<BBE> And messengers hath sent Gideon into all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, `Come down to meet Midian, and capture before them the waters unto Beth-Barah, and the Jordan;' and every man of Ephraim is called, and they capture the waters unto Beth-Barah, and the Jordan,
<BBE> And Samson called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
<BBE> So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.
<BBE> He said to Jether his firstborn, "Get up, and kill them!" But the youth didn't draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth.
<BBE> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, To set  among nobles; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory; For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon them.
<BBE> for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,
<BBE> And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those who were beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the towns and fled. Thus the Philistines came and lived in them.
<BBE> Your servants also and handmaids, and your goodliest young men, and your asses he will take away, and put them to his work.
<BBE> And David fled from Naioth by Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity, and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeks my life?
<BBE> Saul became very angry, and this saying displeased him, and he thought, "They have attributed to David ten thousands, but to me they have attributed thousands! What more can he have but the kingdom?"
<BBE> When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.
<BBE> But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.
<BBE> For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
<BBE> And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth food, And out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days declare the riddle.
<BBE> And he came to the sheepcotes, which were in his way. And there was a cave, into which Saul went, to ease nature: now David and his men lay hid in the inner part of the cave.
<BBE> And the Philistine came on, and drew nigh against David, and his armourbearer before him.
<BBE> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old.
<BBE> (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:
<BBE> But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.
<BBE> Yet you have abandoned me and served other gods. Therefore I will no longer deliver you.
<BBE> For all of you have conspired against me, and no one discloses to me the making of an agreement between my son and the son of Jesse! None of you have had sympathy for me or disclosed to me that my son commissioned my servant against me to ambush me as has been done this day!"
<BBE> And it came to pass in about ten days that Jehovah smote Nabal, and he died.
<BBE> Then Manoah intreated the Lord, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.
<BBE> But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah hath appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.
<BBE> And David saith, `Ye do not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah hath given to us, and He doth preserve us, and doth give the troop which cometh against us into our hand;
<BBE> Being circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; according to the law, a Pharisee:
<BBE> Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day.
<BBE> And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites: Hittites and Amorites and Perizzites and Hivites and Jebusites;
<BBE> And Abigail came to Nabal: and behold he had a feast in his house, like the feast of a king, and Nabal's heart was merry: for he was very drunk: and she told him nothing less or more until morning.
<BBE> The people said to Samuel, "Who is he who said, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring those men, that we may put them to death!"
<BBE> Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time.
<BBE> Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests indeed always entered, accomplishing the offices of sacrifices.
<BBE> And the children of Israel set ambushes round about the city of Gabaa:
<BBE> And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.
<BBE> On the next day, the evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he prophesied in the middle of the house. Now David was playing the lyre with his hand on that day as usual, and the spear was in Saul's hand.
<BBE> For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh:
<BBE> And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
<BBE> "Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. He will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon my people, because their cry has come to me."
<BBE> When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.
<BBE> And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth by Ramah.
<BBE> Now I have heard that you have shearers. Now while your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and nothing of theirs was missing, all the days they were in Carmel.
<BBE> And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Jehovah, and also with men.
<BBE> And it cometh to pass, while Saul spake unto the priest, that the noise which  in the camp of the Philistines goeth on, going on and becoming great, and Saul saith unto the priest, `Remove thy hand.'
<BBE> He had a son, whose name was Saul, an impressive young man; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he. From his shoulders and upward he was taller than any of the people.
<BBE> Then Saul sent messengers to take David; and they saw a company of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as president over them; and the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
<BBE> She said, "I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the journey that you take won't be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into a woman's hand." Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
<BBE> Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
<BBE> for they and their cattle come up, with their tents; they come in as the fulness of the locust for multitude, and of them and of their cattle there is no number, and they come into the land to destroy it.
<BBE> Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.
<BBE> and being perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him,
<BBE> And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.
<BBE> He took the elders of the city and the thorn bushes and briers of the wilderness, and he trampled the men of Succoth with them.
<BBE> Please don't go away, until I come to you, and bring out my present, and lay it before you." He said, "I will wait until you come back."
<BBE> He came to the sheep pens by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were staying in the innermost parts of the cave.
<BBE> And the others indeed were made many priests, because by reason of death they were not suffered to continue:
<BBE> David said to Abner, "Aren't you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord, the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.
<BBE> So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
<BBE> Manoah said, "Now let your words happen. What shall the child's way of life and mission be?"
<BBE> And the priest saith, `The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou didst smite in the valley of Elah, lo, it is wrapt in a garment behind the ephod, if it thou dost take to thyself, take; for there is none other save it in this .' And David saith, `There is none like it -- give it to me.'
<BBE> But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.
<BBE> and Samuel is causing the burnt-offering to go up -- and the Philistines have drawn nigh to battle against Israel -- and Jehovah doth thunder with a great noise, on that day, upon the Philistines, and troubleth them, and they are smitten before Israel.
<BBE> And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
<BBE> And Saul said to his uncle, He told us for certain that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he told him not.
<BBE> and the men who have not died have been smitten with emerods, and the cry of the city goeth up into the heavens.
<BBE> And David goeth thence to Mizpeh of Moab, and saith unto the king of Moab, `Let, I pray thee, my father and my mother go out with you, till that I know what God doth for me;'
<BBE> and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, "Allow me to feel the pillars whereupon the house rests, that I may lean on them."
<BBE> He took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold, the people came out of the city. So, he rose up against them, and struck them.
<BBE> Wherefore ye shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
<BBE> but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and joy with you all,
<BBE> And Yahweh said to Gideon, "The troops that are with you are too many for me to give Midian into their hands; Israel will boast, saying, 'My hand has delivered me.'
<BBE> Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the temple of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon.
<BBE> and the ark of God hath been taken, and the two sons of Eli have died, Hophni and Phinehas.
<BBE> and he strippeth off -- he also -- his garments, and prophesieth -- he also -- before Samuel, and falleth down naked all that day and all the night; therefore they say, `Is Saul also among the prophets?'
<BBE> When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
<BBE> Now the female donkeys of Kish the father of Saul got lost, and Kish said to Saul his son, "Please take one of the servants with you and get up; go and seek the female donkeys."
<BBE> Saul cast his spear at him to strike him. By this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.
<BBE> Please, let our lord command your servants who are before you! Let them seek a man skilled in playing on the lyre. When the evil spirit from God is upon you, he can play on it and you will feel better."
<BBE> Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. Saul was told that David was escaped from Keilah; and he gave up going there.
<BBE> They chose new gods. Then war was in the gates. Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
<BBE> But Christ has arrived as a high priest of the good things to come. Through the greater and more perfect tent not made by hands, that is, not of this creation,

<BBE> Now therefore take and make a new cart: and two kine that have calved, on which there hath come no yoke, tie to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.

<BBE> "Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands
<BBE> Don't consider your servant a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation."

<BBE> make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
<BBE> in which God, more abundantly willing to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, did interpose by an oath,
<BBE> If thy father miss me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.

<BBE> Now consider how great this  was, to whom  the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the spoils.
<BBE> And Gedeon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city Ephra. And all Israel committed fornication with it, and it became a ruin to Gedeon and to all his house.

<BBE> But the spirit of the Lord came upon Gedeon, and be sounded the trumpet and called together the house of Abiezer, to follow him.
<BBE> See that you don't refuse him who speaks. For if they didn't escape when they refused him who warned on the earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,

<BBE> And the men of Ephraim say unto him, `What  this thing thou hast done to us -- not to call for us when thou didst go to fight with Midian?' and they strive with him severely;

<BBE> And they rise early in the morning on the morrow, and lo, Dagon is fallen on its face to the earth, before the ark of Jehovah, and the head of Dagon, and the two palms of its hands are cut off at the threshold, only the fishy part hath been left to him;

<BBE> (and the cook lifteth up the leg, and that which  on it, and setteth before Saul), and he saith, `Lo, that which is left; set  before thee -- eat, for to this appointed season it is kept for thee, saying, The people I have called;' and Saul eateth with Samuel on that day.

<BBE> David asked Ahimelech, "Is there not at your disposal a spear or a sword? For I took neither my sword nor my weapons with me because the king's matter was urgent."

<BBE> God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets,

<BBE> And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.

<BBE> And Samuel saw Saul no more till the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul, because the Lord repented that he had made him king over Israel.

<BBE> And she said to her father: Grant me only this which I desire: Let me go, that I may go about the mountains for two months, and may bewail my virginity with my companions.

<BBE> And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
<BBE> And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.
<BBE> And do not turn aside after the triviality, which have no value and cannot deliver, for they are triviality.
<BBE> Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.

<BBE> For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.
<BBE> And Jonathan smiteth the garrison of the Philistines which  in Geba, and the Philistines hear, and Saul hath blown with a trumpet through all the land, saying, `Let the Hebrews hear.'

<BBE> And all the elders of Israel gather themselves together, and come in unto Samuel to Ramath,
<BBE> Concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, Yahweh is between you and me forever."

<BBE> and apart from faith it is impossible to please well, for it behoveth him who is coming to God to believe that He is, and to those seeking Him He becometh a rewarder.
<BBE> and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, `Who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;'
<BBE> Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
<BBE> Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
<BBE> So they reported it to Saul, saying, "Look! The troops are sinning against Yahweh by eating the animals with the blood!" And he said, "You have dealt treacherously! Roll to me a large stone today!"

<BBE> They put Yahweh's ark on the cart, and the coffer with the golden mice and the images of their tumors.
<BBE> So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
<BBE> And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him: Behold the man, of whom I spoke to thee, this man shall reign over my people.
<BBE> Therefore they inquired of Jehovah further, Will the man yet come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.
<BBE> And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.

<BBE> God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners,
<BBE> Then David put his hand into the bag and took a stone from it and slung it. He struck the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.
<BBE> If they say thus to us, 'Wait until we come to you!' then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.
<BBE> Having thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and were princes of thirty cities, which from his name were called Havoth Jair, that is, the towns of Jair, until this present day in the land of Galaad.
<BBE> Yahweh confused Sisera, all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled away on his feet.
<BBE> If then indeed he were upon earth, he would not even be a priest, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law,
<BBE> Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ, because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.
<BBE> And now make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there has come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;

<BBE> That by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have the strongest comfort, who have fled for refuge to hold fast the hope set before us.
<BBE> But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up; for Jehovah hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be the sign unto us.
<BBE> So Samuel told him all the words, and did not hide them from him. And he answered: It is the Lord: let him do what is good in his sight.
<BBE> Then he said, "I have sinned; yet please honor me now before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and come back with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God."
<BBE> And when the spies saw a man leaving the city, they said to him, "Please show us the entrance of the city, and we will deal kindly with you."
<BBE> And Samuel said to the people, [It is] Jehovah who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
<BBE> for also in Thessalonica once and even twice ye sent to me for my need.

<BBE> And Jehovah said to him, Peace be unto thee: fear not; thou shalt not die.

<BBE> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, "Yahweh has not chosen this one, either."

<BBE> And the priest said: Lo, here is the sword of Goliath the Philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of Terebinth, wrapped up in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take this, take it, for here is no other but this. And David said: There is none like that, give it me.
<BBE> David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the souls of all the people were grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God.
<BBE> And he taketh his staff in his hand, and chooseth for him five smooth stones from the brook, and putteth them in the shepherds' habiliments that he hath, even in the scrip, and his sling  in his hand, and he draweth nigh unto the Philistine.

<BBE> And Saul said to David, Behold my eldest daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife; only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovah's battles. But Saul thought, My hand shall not be upon him, but the hand of the Philistines shall be upon him.
<BBE> nor that he may many times offer himself, even as the chief priest doth enter into the holy places every year with blood of others;

<BBE> And I will raise me up a faithful priest, who shall do according to my heart, and my soul, and I will build him a faithful house, and he shall walk all days before my anointed.
<BBE> lo, my daughter, the virgin, and his concubine, let me bring them out, I pray you, and humble ye them, and do to them that which is good in your eyes, and to this man do not this foolish thing.'
<BBE> while God was testifying at the same time by signs and wonders and various miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will.
<BBE> Samuel said, "Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying Yahweh's voice? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.

<BBE> And the five men go, and come in to Laish, and see the people which  in its midst, dwelling confidently, according to the custom of Zidonians, quiet and confident; and there is none putting to shame in the land in  thing, possessing restraint, and they  far off from the Zidonians, and have no word with  man.

<BBE> And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread thereof;
<BBE> And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months. And she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
<BBE> For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
<BBE> Lo, this day have thine eyes seen how that Jehovah hath given thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and  said to slay thee, and [mine eye] hath pity on thee, and I say, I do not put forth my hand against my lord, for the anointed of Jehovah he .
<BBE> He raises up the poor out of the dust. He lifts up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh's. He has set the world on them.
<BBE> And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.
<BBE> And the men of Israel said, "Did you see this man who has come up? For he is going up to defy Israel! It will be that the man who defeats him, the king will make him very rich with great wealth and will give him his daughter in marriage and will make his father's house free in Israel."
<BBE> and also, the Pre-eminence of Israel doth not lie nor repent, for He  not a man to be penitent.'
<BBE> Jehovah -- broken down are His adversaries, Against them in the heavens He thundereth: Jehovah judgeth the ends of earth, And giveth strength to His king, And exalteth the horn of His anointed.'
<BBE> But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.
<BBE> another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
<BBE> Jonathan said to David, "By Yahweh, the God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there is good toward David, won't I then send to you, and disclose it to you?
<BBE> And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died; for the man was old, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
<BBE> And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
<BBE> It was told to Abimelech that all the lords of the tower of Shechem had gathered.
<BBE> And setting them on fire he let the foxes go, that they might run about hither and thither. And they presently went into the standing corn of the Philistines. Which being set on fire, both the corn that was already carried together, and that which was yet standing, was all burnt, insomuch, that the flame consumed also the vineyards and the oliveyards.
<BBE> Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
<BBE> And they immolated a calf, and offered the child to Heli.
<BBE> So we must go out to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.
<BBE> Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;
<BBE> So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
<BBE> Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
<BBE> And you shall take the ark of the Lord, and lay it on the cart, and the vessels of gold, which you have paid him for sin, you shall put into a little box, at the side thereof: and send it away that it may go.
<BBE> To-day have I begun to ask for him at God? far be it from me! let not the king lay anything against his servant, against any of the house of my father, for thy servant hath known nothing of all this, less or more.'
<BBE> None of theirs was missing from the smallest to the greatest, even sons and daughters, from the plunder up to everything they had taken for themselves; David brought back everything.
<BBE> But the children of Belial said, How should this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no gifts. But he was as one deaf.
<BBE> And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
<BBE> Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger burned against David, and he said, "Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle."
<BBE> And it came to pass, as soon as he had ended offering up the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
<BBE> And he saith unto David, `More righteous thou  than I; for thou hast done me good, and I have done thee evil;
<BBE> And someone does not take for himself the honor, but is called by God, just as Aaron also was.
<BBE> And he said to him: Behold there is a man of God in this city, a famous man: all that he saith, cometh certainly to pass. Now therefore let us go thither, perhaps he may tell us of our way, for which we are come.
<BBE> And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord was come into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, and the earth rang again.
<BBE> And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.
<BBE> And Saul's servants spoke these words to David privately. But David said, "Is it insignificant in your sight to become the son-in-law of the king, as I am a poor and lightly esteemed man?"
<BBE> Then they desired him to consult the Lord, that they might know whether their journey should be prosperous, and the thing should have effect.
<BBE> and to Jesus, mediator of a new covenant; and to  blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel.
<BBE> From Ephraim is their root into Amalek, after you, Benjamin, with your family; from Makir the commanders went down, and from Zebulun those carrying the scepter of the military commander.
<BBE> And these all, having obtained witness through faith, did not receive the promise,
<BBE> Then Gideon built an altar there unto Jehovah, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
<BBE> and she is dwelling under the palm-tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-El, in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel go up unto her for judgment.
<BBE> And Jehovah was with Judah; and he took possession of the hill-country, for he did not dispossess the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
<BBE> Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear --
<BBE> And it cometh to pass afterwards that he loveth a woman in the valley of Sorek, and her name  Delilah,
<BBE> and she calleth the youth I-Chabod, saying, `Honour hath removed from Israel,' because of the taking of the ark of God, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
<BBE> So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the Wadi Besor, but the rest remained.
<BBE> He ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head. And the Philistines seeing that their champion was dead, fled away.
<BBE> And the cook took up the shoulder, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said: Behold what is left, set it before thee, and eat: because it was kept of purpose for thee, when I invited the people. And Saul ate with Samuel that day.
<BBE> And the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he laid them waste, and smote them with hemorrhoids,—Ashdod and its borders.
<BBE> So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
<BBE> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall remain in thy house, shall come that he may be prayed for, and shall offer a piece of silver, and a roll of bread, and shall say: Put me, I beseech thee, to somewhat of the priestly office, that I may eat a morsel of bread.
<BBE> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
<BBE> who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;
<BBE> perfect you in every good work to the doing of his will, doing in you what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ; to whom  glory for the ages of ages. Amen.
<BBE> So now then, look, I know that you will certainly be king and the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.
<BBE> Then David said to the Philistine, "You are coming to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I am coming to you in the name of Yahweh of hosts, the God of the battle lines of Israel, whom you have defied!
<BBE> And Manue said to the angel of the Lord: I beseech thee to consent to my request, and let us dress a kid for thee.
<BBE> And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of Jehovah, were there.
<BBE> If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, we will be servants to you: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, you shall be servants, and shall serve us.
<BBE> David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
<BBE> And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,
<BBE> Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Thamnatha. And when they were come to the vineyards of the town, behold a young lion met him raging and roaring.
<BBE> but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in  likeness of men;
<BBE> neither through blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, did enter in once into the holy places, age-during redemption having obtained;
<BBE> And an angel of the Lord came, and sat under an oak, that was in Ephra, and belonged to Joas the father of the family of Ezri. And when Gedeon his son was threshing and cleansing wheat by the winepress, to flee from Madian,
<BBE> and he said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon;
<BBE> And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.
<BBE> And Saul said: They have brought them from Amalec: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the herds that they might be sacrificed to the Lord thy God, but the rest we have slain.
<BBE> Woe to us: for there was no such great joy yesterday and the day before: Woe to us. Who shall deliver us from the hand of these high gods? these are the gods that struck Egypt with all the plagues in the desert.
<BBE> So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
<BBE> without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually.
<BBE> Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.
<BBE> So the priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine whom you killed in the valley of Elah is here, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to take it for yourself, then take it, for there is no other except it here." And David said, "There is none like it; give it to me."
<BBE> And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambushment.
<BBE> They will ask how you are doing and will give you two loaves, which you will take from their hand.
<BBE> So then, my beloved and greatly desired brothers, my joy and crown, thus stand firm in the Lord, dear friends.
<BBE> So Gaal went out in the sight of the people of Sichem, and fought against Abimelech,
<BBE> And all Israel have heard, saying, `Saul hath smitten the garrison of the Philistines,' and also, `Israel hath been abhorred by the Philistines;' and the people are called after Saul to Gilgal.
<BBE> As soon as you have come into the city, you will immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he blesses the sacrifice. Afterwards those who are invited eat. Now therefore go up; for at this time you will find him."
<BBE> And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
<BBE> When thou shalt depart from me this day, thou shalt find two men by the sepulchre of Rachel in the borders of Benjamin to the south, and they shall say to thee: The asses are found which thou wentest to seek: and thy father thinking no more of the asses is concerned for you, and saith: What shall I do for my son?
<BBE> So the servants of David went back their way, and returning came and told him all the words that he said.
<BBE> And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
<BBE> And the Lord saved Israel that day. And the fight went on as far as Bethaven.
<BBE> Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
<BBE> And it cometh to pass, when Samuel  aged, that he maketh his sons judges over Israel.
<BBE> And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
<BBE> Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Jehovah, the God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down.
<BBE> That through them I may try Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord, and walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.
<BBE> (Now all the people of the land used to go into the forest, for there was honey on the surface of the ground.)
<BBE> and I -- I go out, and have stood by the side of my father in the field where thou , and I speak of thee unto my father, and have seen what [is coming], and have declared to thee.'
<BBE> Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and congratulate with you all.
<BBE> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
<BBE> They were stoned, they were cut asunder, they were tempted, they were put to death by the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being in want, distressed, afflicted:
<BBE> And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the Lord to anger.
<BBE> And Samuel turneth round to go, and he layeth hold on the skirt of his upper robe -- and it is rent!
<BBE> Then all the corrupt and useless men among the men who went with David reacted and said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not give them anything from the plunder which we recovered, except each man may take his own wife and children. They must take them along and go!"
<BBE> And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Strengthen thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth; and they did eat, both of them.
<BBE> And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
<BBE> But if ye are without chastening, of which all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
<BBE> David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.
<BBE> Samuel said, "Why then do you ask me, since Yahweh has departed from you and has become your adversary?
<BBE> If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
<BBE> And the children of Benjamin did so, and took wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught; and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.
<BBE> And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.
<BBE> And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Though thou shouldest detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt offer a burnt-offering, thou shalt offer it up to Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the Angel of Jehovah.
<BBE> Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
<BBE> And he said: Let me go, for there is a solemn sacrifice in the city, one of my brethren hath sent for me: and now if I have found favour in thy eyes, I will go quickly, and see my brethren. For this cause he came not to the king's table.
<BBE> And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upwards.
<BBE> and rise against me do the masters of Gibeah -- and they go round the house against me by night -- me they thought to slay, and my concubine they have humbled, and she dieth;
<BBE> Only, fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth, with all your heart; for see how great things he has done for you.
<BBE> But Hannah didn't go up; for she said to her husband, "Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and stay there forever."
<BBE> Gideon took ten men from his servants, and he did just as Yahweh told him; and because he was too afraid of his father's family and the men of the city to do it during the day, he did it during night.
<BBE> The five princes of the Philistines, and all the Chanaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hevites that dwelt in mount Libanus, from mount Baal Hermon to the entering into Emath.
<BBE> Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh Gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, "Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you."
<BBE> God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
<BBE> only in victuals, and drinks, and different baptisms, and fleshly ordinances -- till the time of reformation imposed upon .
<BBE> And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the door of the house, and went out to go his way, and behold, there lay the woman his concubine at the entrance of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.
<BBE> Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.
<BBE> And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
<BBE> And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
<BBE> And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
<BBE> Samuel said, "Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean?"
<BBE> Then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight.

<BBE> And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.
<BBE> Now I say, I will not drive them out from before you; they will become as thorns for you, and their gods will be a trap for you."
<BBE> And the tribes of Israel sent men to all the families of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that has been done among you?
<BBE> `This  the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and upon their minds I will write them,'
<BBE> Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee: wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David.
<BBE> Become fellow imitators of me, brothers, and observe those who walk in this way, just as you have us as an example.
<BBE> Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up and came to Bethel, and wept, and abode there before Jehovah, and fasted that day until even, and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.
<BBE> He will take one tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give it to his officers, and to his servants.
<BBE> For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.
<BBE> But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;
<BBE> And blessed be thou, who hast kept me to day, from coming to blood, and revenging me with my own hand.
<BBE> This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest,
<BBE> And he took his staff, which he had always in his hands: and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them into the shepherd's scrip, which he had with him, and he took a sling in his hand, and went forth against the Philistine.
<BBE> And Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron was over the house. So they consulted the Lord and said: Shall we go out any more to fight against the children of Benjamin our brethren, or shall we cease? And the Lord said to them: Go up, for to morrow I will deliver them into your hands.
<BBE> For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
<BBE> and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his host was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
<BBE> And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?
<BBE> And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
<BBE> And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
<BBE> For such a chief priest did become us -- kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,
<BBE> Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
<BBE> But Sisara fleeing came to the tent of Jahel the wife of Haber the Cinite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Asor, and the house of Haber the Cinite.
<BBE> Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done!" Jonathan told him, and said, "I certainly did taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die."
<BBE> The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, took it, struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
<BBE> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
<BBE> Then Saul and the men of Israel were gathered and encamped in the valley of Elah, and they formed ranks for the battle to meet the Philistines.
<BBE> And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
<BBE> and blessed  thy discretion, and blessed  thou in that thou hast restrained me this day from coming in with blood, and to restrain my hand to myself.
<BBE> And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye have chosen; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day.
<BBE> By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
<BBE> And it hath come to pass, at the death of the judge -- they turn back and have done corruptly above their fathers, to go after other gods, to serve them, and to bow themselves to them; they have not fallen from their doings, and from their stiff way.
<BBE> They were stoned, were sawn asunder, were tempted, died by the death of the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, afflicted, evil treated,
<BBE> And they cried to the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
<BBE> Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Jephthah spake all his words before Jehovah in Mizpah.
<BBE> But *he*, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down in perpetuity at  right hand of God,
<BBE> And the Philistine said, I have defied the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
<BBE> And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered; and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
<BBE> And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.
<BBE> And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities, twenty-six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
<BBE> Dost not thou possess what Chemosh thy god puts thee in possession of? and whatever Jehovah our God has dispossessed before us, that will we possess.
<BBE> She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
<BBE> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
<BBE> Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don't spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'"
<BBE> `If ye fear Jehovah, and have served Him, and hearkened to His voice, then ye do not provoke the mouth of Jehovah, and ye have been -- both ye and the king who hath reigned over you -- after Jehovah your God.
<BBE> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
<BBE> And she is bitter in soul, and prayeth unto Jehovah, and weepeth greatly,
<BBE> So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. Then the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon David from that day on. Then Samuel got up and went to Ramah.
<BBE> and both straw and provender are for our asses, and also bread and wine there are for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man with thy servants; there is no lack of anything.'
<BBE> Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
<BBE> not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they didn't continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them," says the Lord.
<BBE> She called the boy Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel," referring to the capture of the ark of God and concerning her father-in-law and husband.
<BBE> So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines. They drove off their livestock and dealt them a heavy blow. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
<BBE> And the sons of Benjamin number themselves on that day; out of the cities  twenty and six thousand men drawing sword, apart from the inhabitants of Gibeah,  numbered themselves, seven hundred chosen men;
<BBE> And they come in over against Gibeah -- ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel -- and the battle  grievous, and they have not known that the evil is striking against them.
<BBE> Gideon said, "Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."
<BBE> For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:
<BBE> And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan.
<BBE> Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. I will bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them what seems good to you; but to this man don't do any such folly."
<BBE> By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up.
<BBE> Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.
<BBE> but on the third day thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself on the day of the business, and abide by the stone Ezel.

<BBE> And after him hath been Shamgar son of Anath, and he smiteth the Philistines -- six hundred men -- with an ox-goad, and he saveth -- he also -- Israel.
<BBE> Tell of it, ye that ride on white asses, Ye that sit on rich carpets, And ye that walk by the way.
<BBE> And it cometh to pass, all his acquaintance heretofore, see, and lo, with prophets he hath prophesied, and the people say one unto another, `What  this hath happened to the son of Kish? is Saul also among the prophets?'
<BBE> But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
<BBE> And ye have cried out in that day because of the king whom ye have chosen for yourselves, and Jehovah doth not answer you in that day.'
<BBE> And his servants declare to David these words, and the thing is right in the eyes of David, to be son-in-law to the king; and the days have not been full,
<BBE> And the five men that had gone to spy out the land went up, entered in thither,  took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men that were girded with weapons of war.

<BBE> And Achish trusted David, saying, "He has made himself utterly hated among his people in Israel, and he will be my servant forever."
<BBE> So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said to him, "The Philistines are on you, Samson!" The ambush was waiting in the inner room. He broke them off his arms like a thread.
<BBE> And when David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep,
<BBE> Then broken were the horse-heels, By pransings -- pransings of its mighty ones.
<BBE> as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.
<BBE> for your partnership in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;
<BBE> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
<BBE> But after Gedeon was dead, the children of Israel turned again, and committed fornication with Baalim. And they made a covenant with Baal, that he should be their god:
<BBE> So David checked his men with these words, and didn't allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
<BBE> Now therefore your king is here, whom you have chosen and desired: Behold the Lord hath given you a king.
<BBE> And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
<BBE> And it cometh to pass when the sons of Israel have cried unto Jehovah, concerning Midian,
<BBE> He said to them, "Out of the eater came out food. Out of the strong came out sweetness." They couldn't in three days declare the riddle.
<BBE> And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
<BBE> And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim;
<BBE> Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you."
<BBE> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
<BBE> Then he took his staff in his hand, picked out for himself five smooth stones from the wadi, and he put them in his shepherd's bag, in the pouch. And with his sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine.
<BBE> The woman quickly ran and told her husband, and she said to him, "Look! The man who came to me the other day appeared to me."
<BBE> And he put to the sword Nob, the city of the priests, from man to woman, from child to infant, and ox and donkey and sheep; all to the sword.
<BBE> And Manoah said to his wife, "We will certainly die because we have seen God."
<BBE> For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he sware by himself,
<BBE> And Achish said, "Against whom have you raided today?" David said, "Against the Negev of Judah and against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites and against the Negev of the Kenites."
<BBE> Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,
<BBE> Certain, indeed, even through envy and contention, and certain also through good-will, do preach the Christ;
<BBE> The descendants of Benjamin went out to meet the troops, and they lured them away from the city and began to inflict casualties on the troops as before, on the main road, one of which goes up to Bethel, the other to Gibeah; and in the field there were about thirty men of Israel.
<BBE> And he said unto him, Far from it; thou shalt not die: behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.
<BBE> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
<BBE> And the men of Israel have turned back unto the sons of Benjamin, and smite them by the mouth of the sword out of the city, -- men unto cattle, unto all that is found; also all the cities which are found they have sent into fire.
<BBE> Because of this it behoveth  more abundantly to take heed to the things heard, lest we may glide aside,
<BBE> And, "You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the works of your hands;
<BBE> But when the judge was dead, they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them. They didn't cease what they were doing, or give up their stubborn ways.
<BBE> And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
<BBE> Then Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, in what is thy great strength, and with what thou mightest be bound to overpower thee.
<BBE> (Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and they had buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away the necromancers and the soothsayers out of the land.)
<BBE> By faith, Noah, oracularly warned concerning things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which  according to faith.
<BBE> And he said to them: When the Lord therefore shall have delivered Zebee and Salmana into my hands, I will thresh your flesh with the thorns and briers of the desert.
<BBE> They struck at that time about ten thousand men of Moab, every strong man, and every man of valor. No man escaped.
<BBE> But without faith [it is] impossible to please . For he that draws near to God must believe that he is, and  he is a rewarder of them who seek him out.
<BBE> And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.
<BBE> And the Philistines seize him, and pick out his eyes, and bring him down to Gaza, and bind him with two brazen fetters; and he is grinding in the prison-house.
<BBE> But his wife said unto him, If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.
<BBE> And Jehovah saith unto Gideon, `Too many  the people who  with thee for My giving Midian into their hand, lest Israel beautify itself against Me, saying, My hand hath given salvation to me;
<BBE> The Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. They forgot Yahweh their God, and they served the Baals and the Asheroth.
<BBE> But Samuel said, "Then what is this bleating of the sheep that I hear in my ears and the lowing of the cattle that I am hearing?"
<BBE> And Samuel riseth early to meet Saul in the morning, and it is declared to Samuel, saying, `Saul hath come in to Carmel, and lo, he is setting up to himself a monument, and goeth round, and passeth over, and goeth down to Gilgal.'
<BBE> Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
<BBE> And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.
<BBE> and the people make unto the spoil, and take sheep, and oxen, and sons of the herd, and slaughter on the earth, and the people eat with the blood.
<BBE> And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before Jehovah is your way wherein ye go.

<BBE> For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.
<BBE> Saul also departed to his own house in Gabaa: and there went with him a part of the army, whose hearts God had touched.
<BBE> You will see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I will give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.
<BBE> He said: Let me die with the Philistines. And when he had strongly shook the pillars, the house fell upon all the princes, and the rest of the multitude that was there: and he killed many more at his death, than he had killed before in his life.
<BBE> "The trees said to the vine, 'Come and reign over us.'
<BBE> A son of a year  Saul in his reigning, yea, two years he hath reigned over Israel,
<BBE> And Jephte again sent word by them, and commanded them to say to the king of Ammon:
<BBE> And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
<BBE> Now therefore come down, as thy soul hath desired to come down: and it shall be our business to deliver him into the king's hands.
<BBE> For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have tasted also the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
<BBE> And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go ye every man to his city.
<BBE> We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire."
<BBE> So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.
<BBE> Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
<BBE> And knowing the voice of the young man the Levite, and lodging with him, they said to him: Who brought thee hither? what dost thou here? why wouldst thou come hither?

<BBE> So Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me in the bed, so that I can kill him."
<BBE> And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.
<BBE> As also a piece of a cake of figs, and two bunches of raisins. And when he had eaten them his spirit returned, and he was refreshed: for he had not eaten bread, nor drunk water three days, and three nights.
<BBE> And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
<BBE> And the people came to Bethel, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly,
<BBE> And the vine saith to them, Have I ceased from my new wine, which is rejoicing gods and men, that I have gone to stagger over the trees?
<BBE> The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn't yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing;
<BBE> Then the Philistines going up into the land of Juda, camped in the place which afterwards was called Lechi, that is, the Jawbone, where their army was spread.
<BBE> And Samuel slept till morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord. And Samuel feared to tell the vision to Heli.
<BBE> They said, "If you are sending the ark of the God of Israel away, you must not send it away empty, but by all means return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will become known to you why his hand is not turned aside from you."
<BBE> And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honor; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.
<BBE> And Eli answereth and saith, `Go in peace, and the God of Israel doth give thy petition which thou hast asked of Him.'
<BBE> When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth."
<BBE> And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.

<BBE> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her;
<BBE> Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment,
<BBE> And Jerubbaal son of Joash goeth and dwelleth in his own house,
<BBE> And one answered another, saying: And who is their father? therefore it became a proverb: Is Saul also among the prophets?
<BBE> He came to the men of Succoth, and said, "See Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?'"

<BBE> And she saith to him, `Give to me a blessing; when the south land thou hast given me -- then thou hast given to me springs of water; and Caleb giveth to her the upper springs and the lower springs.
<BBE> And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.

<BBE> Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.
<BBE> When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, 'For Yahweh and for Gideon!'"
<BBE> And having taken two men of Madian, Oreb and Zeb: Oreb they slew in the rock of Oreb, and Zeb in the winepress of Zeb. And they pursued Madian, carrying the heads of Oreb and Zeb to Gedeon beyond the waters of the Jordan.
<BBE> Strengthen yourselves, and become men, O Philistines, lest ye do service to Hebrews, as they have done to you -- then ye have become men, and have fought.'

<BBE> And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
<BBE> Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.
<BBE> If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,
<BBE> Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

<BBE> Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood.

<BBE> For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
<BBE> And the woman said to him: Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
<BBE> And they have taken that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and come in against Laish, against a people quiet and confident, and smite them by the mouth of the sword, and the city have burnt with fire,
<BBE> And the sons of Israel go up and down thence at that time, each to his tribe, and to his family; and they go out thence each to his inheritance.
<BBE> If ye fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and rebel not against the commandment of Jehovah, then both ye and the king also that reigns over you shall continue following Jehovah your God.

<BBE> For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;

<BBE> And the men of Ephraim are called together, and pass over northward, and say to Jephthah, `Wherefore has thou passed over to fight against the Bene-Ammon, and on us hast not called to go with thee? thy house we burn over thee with fire.'
<BBE> And Saul feared David, because the Lord was with him, and was departed from himself.
<BBE> And the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon him, and he tore the lion apart as one might tear apart a male kid goat (he was bare-handed). But he did not tell his father and mother what he had done.
<BBE> And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why should he be put to death? what has he done?
<BBE> So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
<BBE> Saul was a child of one year when he began to reign, and he reigned two years over Israel.
<BBE> Now Ahijah, the son of Ahitub (the brother of Ichabod), the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of Yahweh at Shiloh, was carrying an ephod. The troops did not know that Jonathan had gone.
<BBE> And David's servants came to Abigail to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying: David hath sent us to thee, to take thee to himself for a wife.
<BBE> Now David had said, "Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him. He has returned me evil for good.
<BBE> The raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;
<BBE> and changeth his behaviour before their eyes, and feigneth himself mad in their hand, and scribbleth on the doors of the gate, and letteth down his spittle unto his beard.
<BBE> For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away.
<BBE> The things which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these do ye, and the God of peace shall be with you.
<BBE> And he said to them: Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
<BBE> And may be found in him, not having my justice, which is of the law, but that which is of the faith of Christ Jesus, which is of God, justice in faith:
<BBE> And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
<BBE> And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
<BBE> You have declared today how you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn't kill me.
<BBE> And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.
<BBE> The mountains melted from before the Lord, even that Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel.
<BBE> Therefore Saul said unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, Show the right. And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot; but the people escaped.
<BBE> He was very thirsty, and called on Yahweh, and said, "You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now shall I die of thirst, and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?"
<BBE> And his mother's relatives spoke all these words concerning him to all the lords of Shechem; and they supported Abimelech, for they said, "He is our relative."
<BBE> Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.
<BBE> But Adoni-Bezek fled. They pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.
<BBE> It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
<BBE> David said to Achish, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?"
<BBE> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
<BBE> But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.
<BBE> And David arose and fled that day from the face of Saul: and came to Achis the king of Geth:
<BBE> And they come in unto their brethren, at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brethren say to them, `What -- ye?'
<BBE> His father-in-law, the young lady's father, kept him there; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank, and stayed there.
<BBE> So all of Benjamin who fell on that day were twenty-five thousand sword-wielding men; all of these were able men.
<BBE> And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.
<BBE> And Gideon saith unto him, `O, my lord -- and Jehovah is with us! -- and why hath all this found us? and where  all His wonders which our fathers recounted to us, saying, Hath not Jehovah brought us up out of Egypt? and now Jehovah hath left us, and doth give us into the hand of Midian.'
<BBE> The one edge  fixed on the north over-against Michmash, and the one on the south over-against Gibeah.
<BBE> Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:
<BBE> all of the valiant men set out and went all night and took the corpse of Saul and the corpses of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan, and they came to Jabesh and burned them there.
<BBE> His concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.
<BBE> who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
<BBE> But the woman, at the dawning of the day, came to the door of the house where her lord lodged, and there fell down.
<BBE> So the elders of Jabesh said to him, "Leave us alone for seven days so that we may send messengers in all the territory of Israel, and if there is no deliverer for us, then we will come out to you."
<BBE> And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
<BBE> And Saul smote Amalek from Havilah as thou comest to Shur, which is opposite to Egypt.
<BBE> Be mindful of those leading you, who did speak to you the word of God, whose faith -- considering the issue of the behaviour -- be imitating,
<BBE> And the angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, "I brought you up from Egypt, and I brought you to the land that I had promised to your ancestors. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you.
<BBE> And David went thence to Mizpeh in Moab, and said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth amongst you, till I know what God will do for me.
<BBE> And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.
<BBE> So Samuel brought near all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected by lot.
<BBE> So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
<BBE> And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.
<BBE> and David goeth up and his men, and they push unto the Geshurite, and the Gerizite, and the Amalekite, (for they are inhabitants of the land from of old), as thou comest in to Shur and unto the land of Egypt,
<BBE> And Samson answered her: If I shall be bound with seven cords made of sinews not yet dry, but still moist, I shall be weak like other men.
<BBE> He also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel. He lay naked all that day and all night. Therefore they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
<BBE> They did therefore in this manner: and taking two kine, that had suckling calves, they yoked them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.
<BBE> He said, 'Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city. My brother has commanded me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go away and see my brothers.' Therefore he has not come to the king's table."
<BBE> And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the heavens and to the beasts of the field.
<BBE> And his wife answered him: If the Lord had a mind to kill us, he would not have received a holocaust and libations at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor have told us the things that are to come.
<BBE> Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
<BBE> Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for the one who promised is faithful.
<BBE> and the sons of Benjamin come out from Gibeah, and destroy in Israel on that day two and twenty thousand men -- to the earth.
<BBE> for a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which was both the lamp-stand, and the table, and the bread of the presence -- which is called `Holy;'
<BBE> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.
<BBE> and hath struck  into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the hook bringeth up doth the priest take for himself; thus they do to all Israel who are coming in, there, in Shiloh.
<BBE> neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had showed unto Israel.
<BBE> And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?
<BBE> Saul heard that David was discovered, with the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.
<BBE> For Yahweh will not forsake his people for the sake of his great name, because Yahweh has decided to make you his own people.
<BBE> Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in the same way partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,
<BBE> Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do mightily, and shalt surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
<BBE> And the children of Benjamin did, as they had been commanded: and according to their number, they carried off for themselves every man his wife of them that were dancing: and they went into their possession and built up their cities, and dwelt in them.
<BBE> And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto Jehovah to Mizpah? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
<BBE> This thing is not good which thou hast done. As Jehovah liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not guarded your master, Jehovah's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.
<BBE> that ye may be harmless and simple, irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation; among whom ye appear as lights in  world,
<BBE> If a man sin against a man, then hath God judged him; but if against Jehovah a man sin, who doth pray for him?' and they hearken not to the voice of their father, though Jehovah hath delighted to put them to death.
<BBE> And Samuel calleth the people unto Jehovah to Mizpeh,
<BBE> The kings came and fought, the kings of Chanaan fought in Thanach by the waters of Mageddo, and yet they took no spoils.
<BBE> So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Armies, who sits above the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
<BBE> Now the Philistines gathering together their troops to battle, assembled at Socho of Juda, and camped between Socho and Azeca in the borders of Dommim.
<BBE> That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.
<BBE> Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
<BBE> The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.
<BBE> For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.
<BBE> And Jonathan saith unto David, `Come, and we go out into the field;' and they go out both of them into the field.
<BBE> And she said unto her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
<BBE> They have been far off from the house of Micah -- and the men who  in the houses which  near the house of Micah have been called together, and overtake the sons of Dan,
<BBE> And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down to oppose Midian, and capture from them the waters up to Beth Barah and the Jordan." He called out all the men of Ephraim, and they captured the waters up to Beth Barah and the Jordan.
<BBE> Her wise ladies answered her, Yes, she returned answer to herself,
<BBE> And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
<BBE> (and the six hundred men girded with their weapons of war, who  of the sons of Dan, are standing at the opening of the gate), --
<BBE> Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried to Yahweh.
<BBE> But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.
<BBE> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
<BBE> David said to Achish, "Very well, you will know what your servant can do." Achish said to David, "Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life."
<BBE> When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; so they turned aside there, and said to him, "Who brought you here? What do you do in this place? What do you have here?"
<BBE> Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
<BBE> In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away.
<BBE> There being no man at all who brought them any succour, because they dwelt far from Sidon, and had no society or business with any man. And the city was in the land of Rohob: and they rebuilt it and dwelt therein.
<BBE> But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
<BBE> Then Saul said, "So may God do to me and more, you will certainly die today, Jonathan!"
<BBE> Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you; and as soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart."
<BBE> Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the middle between every two tails.
<BBE> Nevertheless you have done well in communicating to my tribulation.
<BBE> And the Lord sent a very evil spirit between Abimelech and the inhabitants of Sichem: who began to detest him,
<BBE> And they will salute thee, and will give thee two loaves, and thou shalt take them at their hand.
<BBE> And I thought  necessary Epaphroditus -- my brother, and fellow-workman, and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and servant to my need -- to send unto you,
<BBE> The first therefore also indeed had ordinances of service, and the sanctuary, a worldly one.
<BBE> By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
<BBE> And Gideon said, Therefore when Jehovah delivers Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will thresh your flesh with thorns of the wilderness and with briars.
<BBE> And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah, for men despised the offering of Jehovah.
<BBE> And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.
<BBE> so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest;
<BBE> And they returned to their brethren in Saraa and Esthaol, who asked them what they had done? to whom they answered:
<BBE> Then all the people said to Samuel, "Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God so that we will not die, because we have added to all our sins by requesting a king for ourselves."
<BBE> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
<BBE> But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:
<BBE> For when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, Yahweh's angel ascended in the flame of the altar. Manoah and his wife watched; and they fell on their faces to the ground.
<BBE> And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went hither and thither.
<BBE> for also our God  a consuming fire.
<BBE> And Gideon said to them, "Let me make a request of you, that each of you give to me an ornamental ring from his plunder." (They had ornamental rings of gold, because they were Ishmaelites.)
<BBE> Arise therefore in the night with the people that is with thee and he hid in the field:
<BBE> And Samuel told the people the law of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the Lord: and Samuel sent away all the people, every one to his own house.
<BBE> And he cometh in unto the men of Succoth, and saith, `Lo Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye reproached me, saying, Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand that we give to thy men who  wearied bread?'
<BBE> And we also will be like all nations: and our king shall judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles for us.
<BBE> So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
<BBE> Then Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" And David said, "It is my voice, my lord the king."
<BBE> Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
<BBE> And Gaal spoke again and said, "Look, people are coming down from Tabbur-erez, and one division is coming from the direction of Elon-meonenim."
<BBE> And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men: all these, men of valour.
<BBE> It was so, that after they had carried it there, Yahweh's hand was against the city with a very great confusion; and he struck the men of the city, both small and great so that tumors broke out on them.
<BBE> And just as it is destined for people to die once, and after this, judgment,
<BBE> and, now, station yourselves, and I judge you before Jehovah, with all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which He did with you, and with your fathers.
<BBE> And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord;
<BBE> And the man went to the land of the Hittites, and he built a city and named it Luz; this is its name to this day.
<BBE> that Jehovah called to Samuel. And he said, Here am I.
<BBE> For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh;
<BBE> And the next day again, when they rose in the morning, they found Dagon lying upon his face on the earth before the ark of the Lord: and the head of Dagon, and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold:
<BBE> Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Juda before mentioned, whose name was Isai, who had eight sons, and was an old man in the days of Saul, and of great age among men.
<BBE> For this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things [we have] heard, lest in any way we should slip away.
<BBE> So the Philistines were subdued, and they stopped coming within the border of Israel. Yahweh's hand was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
<BBE> For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
<BBE> Even as also in another  he says, *Thou*  a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.
<BBE> And Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with him, and was departed from Saul.
<BBE> and Israel sendeth messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me pass over, I pray thee, through thy land, and the king of Edom hearkened not; and also unto the king of Moab hath  sent, and he hath not been willing; and Israel abideth in Kadesh,
<BBE> As Samuel turned around to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore.
<BBE> and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, "Don't you answer, Abner?" Then Abner answered, "Who are you who cries to the king?"
<BBE> But if I say this to the young man, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' go, for Yahweh has sent you away.
<BBE> and another company turned the way to Beth-horon; and the other company turned the way to the district that looks over the ravine of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
<BBE> —for my father fought for you, and endangered his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian;
<BBE> And it cometh to pass, in his coming in, that he bloweth with a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim, and go down with him do the sons of Israel from the hill-country, and he before them;
<BBE> Jehovah putteth to death, and keepeth alive, He bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up.
<BBE> And the custom of the priests with the people was this: When any man brought a sacrifice, as the meat was boiling, the servant of the priest would take a three-pronged meat fork in his hand
<BBE> Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul.
<BBE> In those days there was no king in Israel. In those days the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day, their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.
<BBE> And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath; and he sought no more for him.
<BBE> to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, `King of righteousness,' and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)
<BBE> and Kish  father of Saul, and Ner father of Abner  son of Ahiel.
<BBE> Saul's servants said to him, "See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.
<BBE> Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
<BBE> And all the masters of the tower of Shechem hear, and go in unto the high place of the house of the god Berith,
<BBE> Moreover, that entire generation was gathered to their ancestors, and another generation grew up after them who did not know Yahweh or the work he had done for Israel.
<BBE> The trees set out to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us.'
<BBE> And he sent messengers unto Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they constrain the city to take part against thee.
<BBE> Paul and Timotheus, bondmen of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with  overseers and ministers;
<BBE> And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.
<BBE> And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote them.
<BBE> When the boy came up to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called out after the boy and said, "Is not the arrow beyond you?"
<BBE> They answered: We will give them most willingly. And spreading a mantle on the ground, they cast upon it the earlets of the spoils.
<BBE> Then David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to the words of people who say: 'Look, David is seeking to do you harm'?
<BBE> Please forgive the transgression of your female servant, because Yahweh will certainly make a lasting house for my lord, because my lord is fighting the battles of Yahweh, and evil will not be found in you as long as you live.
<BBE> "Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem, 'Is it better for you that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?' Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh."
<BBE> The men who didn't die were struck with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
<BBE> He answered him: We came out from Bethlehem Juda, and we are going to our home, which is on the side of mount Ephraim, from whence we went to Bethlehem: and now we go to the house of God, and none will receive us under his roof:
<BBE> And they are gathered to Mizpeh, and draw water, and pour out before Jehovah, and fast on that day, and say there, `We have sinned against Jehovah;' and Samuel judgeth the sons of Israel in Mizpeh.
<BBE> For he has not subjected to angels the habitable world which is to come, of which we speak;
<BBE> and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world, He saith, `And let them bow before him -- all messengers of God;'
<BBE> And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
<BBE> But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
<BBE> Therefore they enquired of the Lord further, if the man should yet come thither. And the Lord answered, Behold he hath hid himself among the stuff.
<BBE> Then all the children of Israel went out and gathered together as one man from Dan to Bersabee, with the land of Galaad, to the Lord in Maspha:
<BBE> Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.
<BBE> But Nabal answered David's servants and said, "Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? Today, there are many servants breaking away from the presence of their masters.
<BBE> Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan declared to him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as previously.
<BBE> and, now, thy kingdom doth not stand, Jehovah hath sought for Himself a man according to His own heart, and Jehovah chargeth him for leader over His people, for thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.'
<BBE> The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
<BBE> and he saith to his mother, `The eleven hundred silverlings which have been taken of thine, and [of which] thou hast sworn, and also spoken in mine ears; lo, the silver  with me, I have taken it;' and his mother saith, `Blessed  my son of Jehovah.'
<BBE> Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.
<BBE> Her rival provoked her severely, to irritate her, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.
<BBE> For a man has found his enemy but sent him on his way safely. Now may Yahweh reward you with good in return for this day, for what you have done for me.
<BBE> She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, "Behold, your servant is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."
<BBE> And Gideon cometh -- and the hundred men who  with him -- into the extremity of the camp,  the beginning of the middle watch (it hath only just confirmed the watchmen), and they blow with trumpets -- dashing in pieces also the pitchers which  in their hand;
<BBE> And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
<BBE> But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
<BBE> And the Lord said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
<BBE> And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
<BBE> And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.
<BBE> And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
<BBE> And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?
<BBE> And he turned a little aside from him to another: and said the same word. And the people answered him as before.
<BBE> Now when David returned, after be slew the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels of joy, and cornets.
<BBE> Indeed, nearly everything is purified with blood according to the law, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
<BBE> for those in Hormah, for those in Bor Ashan, for those in Athach,
<BBE> For Jehovah will not forsake his people for his great name's sake, because it hath pleased Jehovah to make you a people unto himself.

<BBE> and the one detachment turneth the way of Beth-Horon, and the one detachment turneth the way of the border which is looking on the valley of the Zeboim, toward the wilderness.
<BBE> Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as before.
<BBE> And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba); and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
<BBE> But the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah that he had sent him.
<BBE> But Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for to-day Jehovah has wrought deliverance in Israel.

<BBE> And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.

<BBE> So then, this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against her by lot.
<BBE> But the king of the Ammonites did not listen to the message that Jephthah sent to him.
<BBE> For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy.
<BBE> So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them.
<BBE> For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
<BBE> The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, saying, "We have sinned against you, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baals."

<BBE> Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.
<BBE> And the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant; and his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said to him, Behold now, the day draws toward evening—I pray you stay all night; behold, the day is declining, lodge here, and let thy heart be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go to thy tent.
<BBE> And Yahweh said to the Israelites, "Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, from the Ammonites, and from the Philistines?
<BBE> And Saul summoneth the whole of the people to battle, to go down to Keilah, to lay siege unto David and unto his men.

<BBE> Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
<BBE> Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, "Doesn't David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the woods, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?
<BBE> And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food.
<BBE> But the woman said to him, "Look, you know what Saul did, how he exterminated the mediums and the soothsayers from the land! Why are you setting a trap for my life to kill me?"
<BBE> For I will be merciful to their iniquities, And their sins will I remember no more.
<BBE> And the anger of Jehovah doth burn against Israel, and He saith, `Because that this nation have transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to My voice --

<BBE> He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, "Whoever doesn't come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen." The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.

<BBE> War came again, so David went out and fought against the Philistines and defeated them thoroughly so that they fled before him.

<BBE> there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,
<BBE> And when Dalila had done this, she said to him: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And awaking out of his sleep he drew out the nail with the hairs and the lace.

<BBE> as to whom it had been said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:
<BBE> Please don't let my lord pay attention to this worthless fellow, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your servant, didn't see my lord's young men, whom you sent.

<BBE> The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood.
<BBE> He sent it to those who were in Bethel, to those who were in Ramoth of the South, to those who were in Jattir,
<BBE> And the custom of the priests with the people : any man sacrificing a sacrifice -- then hath the servant of the priest come in when the flesh is boiling, and the hook of three teeth in his hand,
<BBE> Being confident of this very thing, that he, who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus.

<BBE> for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is appointed, whence [it is] necessary for this one to have also something that he may offer;

<BBE> And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And it was so, that, when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;

<BBE> And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Did I plainly reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt, in Pharaoh's house,
<BBE> (In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, "Come, and let us go to the seer"; for he who is now called a prophet was before called a seer.)

<BBE> for if the word being spoken through messengers did become stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience did receive a just recompense,
<BBE> choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
<BBE> Aren't they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
<BBE> And he said to him, "We are crossing over from Bethlehem in Judah up to the remote areas of the hill country of Ephraim, where I am from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, but now I am going to Yahweh's house, but no one took me in to spend the night.

<BBE> And Abimelech coming near the tower, fought stoutly: and approaching to the gate, endeavoured to set fire to it:

<BBE> And David's men said to him, "Look, today is the day about which Yahweh said to you, 'See, I am giving your enemy into your hand, and you can do to him whatever seems good to you.'" So David got up and secretly cut the hem of Saul's robe.
<BBE> And they arose early; and when it was about the dawning of the day, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, Arise, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, into the street.

<BBE> The Philistine said to David, "Come to me so that I can give your flesh to the birds of heaven and to the wild animals of the field!"

<BBE> And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
<BBE> And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.
<BBE> and these ten cuttings of the cheese thou dost take in to the head of the thousand, and thy brethren thou dost inspect for welfare, and their pledge dost receive.'

<BBE> And so we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
<BBE> Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees;
<BBE> And all Midian and Amalek and the sons of the east have been gathered together, and pass over, and encamp in the valley of Jezreel,
<BBE> that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that informs me when my son has made [a covenant] with the son of Jesse; and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or informs me that my son has stirred up my servant as a lier-in-wait against me, as at this day?
<BBE> And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. And she opened the flask of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
<BBE> And Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
<BBE> And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey; he reached down and took it and killed one thousand men with it.

<BBE> When she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, his soul was troubled to death.
<BBE> Samson said to her, "If you tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that are not dried up, I will become weak like everyone else."

<BBE> Jonathan told David, saying, "Saul my father seeks to kill you. Now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning, and live in a secret place, and hide yourself.
<BBE> So David again inquired of Yahweh, and Yahweh answered him and said, "Get up, go down to Keilah, for I am giving the Philistines into your hand."
<BBE> Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.
<BBE> whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things.
<BBE> And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Is it a light thing in your eyes to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
<BBE> And the Lord said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
<BBE> and they turn and go, and put the infants, and the cattle, and the baggage, before them.
<BBE> Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.
<BBE> for of those beasts whose blood is brought for sin into the holy places through the chief priest -- of these the bodies are burned without the camp.
<BBE> And her husband riseth and goeth after her, to speak unto her heart, to bring her back, and his young man  with him, and a couple of asses; and she bringeth him into the house of her father, and the father of the young woman seeth him, and rejoiceth to meet him.
<BBE> So Jonathan the son of Saul got up and went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him through God.
<BBE> And it came to pass the next day that Saul set the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote Ammon until the heat of the day: and it came to pass that they who remained were scattered, and not two of them were left together.

<BBE> Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands
<BBE> And make straight steps with your feet: that no one, halting, may go out of the way; but rather be healed.
<BBE> And know also *ye*, O Philippians, that in  beginning of the gospel, when I came out of Macedonia, no assembly communicated  to me in  way of giving and receiving save *ye* alone;

<BBE> So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah.
<BBE> So she wept before Samson and complained, saying: Thou hatest me, and dost not love me: therefore thou wilt not expound to me the riddle which thou hast proposed to the sons of my people. But he answered: I would not tell it to my father and mother, and how can I tell it to thee?
<BBE> And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.
<BBE> And three thousand men of Judah go down unto the cleft of the rock Etam, and say to Samson, `Hast thou now known that the Philistines are rulers over us? and what  this thou hast done to us?' And he saith to them, `As they did to me, so I did to them.'
<BBE> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
<BBE> Now no skilled craftsman could be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, "So that the Hebrews cannot make swords or spears for themselves."
<BBE> And he said: With the jawbone of an ass, with the jaw of the colt of asses I have destroyed them, and have slain a thousand men.
<BBE> The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. When they joined battle, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field.

<BBE> and he goeth through the wilderness, and compasseth the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and cometh in at the rising of the sun of the land of Moab, and they encamp beyond Arnon, and have not come into the border of Moab, for Arnon  the border of Moab.
<BBE> And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.

<BBE> And Samson saith to them, `Let me, I pray you, put forth to you a riddle; if ye certainly declare it to me  the seven days of the banquet, and have found  out, then I have given to you thirty linen shirts, and thirty changes of garments;
<BBE> And he shewed them how to enter into the city. And they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.
<BBE> And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:

<BBE> And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
<BBE> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
<BBE> Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;
<BBE> And he separated also therein a little temple for the god, and made an ephod, and theraphim, that is to say, a priestly garment, and idols: and he filled the hand of one of his sons, and he became his priest.
<BBE> And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took his charge and went, as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the wagon-defence; and the host which was going forth to the battle-array shouted for the fight.
<BBE> (Nor were the children of Benjamin ignorant that the children of Israel were come up to Maspha.) And the Levite the husband of the woman that was killed, being asked, how so great a wickedness had been committed,
<BBE> and, so fearful was the sight, Moses said, I am exceedingly afraid and full of trembling;)
<BBE> By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.
<BBE> Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:
<BBE> For I have foretold unto him, that I will judge his house for ever, for iniquity, because he knew that his sons did wickedly, and did not chastise them.
<BBE> His sons didn't walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.
<BBE> And David said, `Only, in vain I have kept all that this  hath in the wilderness, and nothing hath been looked after of all that he hath, and he turneth back to me evil for good;
<BBE> Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
<BBE> And he saith unto them, `Look at me, and thus do; and lo, I am coming into the extremity of the camp -- and it hath been -- as I do so ye do;
<BBE> And Samuel turned about to go away: but he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
<BBE> And he waiteth seven days, according to the appointment with Samuel, and Samuel hath not come to Gilgal, and the people are scattered from off him.
<BBE> And the elders of Gilead say unto Jephthah, `Jehovah is hearkening between us -- if according to thy word we do not so.'
<BBE> But the people took of the spoils sheep and oxen, as the firstfruits of those things that were slain, to offer sacrifice to the Lord their God in Galgal.
<BBE> And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
<BBE> and the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood.
<BBE> And when his servants had told David the words that Saul had said, the word was pleasing in the eyes of David to be the king's son in law.
<BBE> So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
<BBE> So the cook took up the shank and what was on it and put it before Saul, and he said, "Look, the saved portion is placed before you—eat, because it has been kept for you for the appointed time," and he said, "I have invited the people." So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
<BBE> And David came to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour-bearer.
<BBE> And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan and swore, "As Yahweh lives, he will not be put to death!"
<BBE> In these days hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world.
<BBE> Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?
<BBE> And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, who hath slain many of us.
<BBE> And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about; and they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
<BBE> And it cometh to pass, after  days, in the days of wheat-harvest, that Samson looketh after his wife, with a kid of the goats, and saith, `I go in unto my wife, to the inner chamber;' and her father hath not permitted him to go in,
<BBE> who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself.
<BBE> And lo, a man, an aged one, hath come from his work from the field in the evening, and the man  of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he  a sojourner in Gibeah, and the men of the place  Benjamites.
<BBE> And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
<BBE> And the people had come into the wood, and behold, the honey flowed; but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.
<BBE> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel to Ramah,
<BBE> And Samson lieth down till the middle of the night, and riseth in the middle of the night, and layeth hold on the doors of the gate of the city, and on the two side posts, and removeth them with the bar, and putteth on his shoulders, and taketh them up unto the top of the hill, which  on the front of Hebron.
<BBE> He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness, because no man shall prevail by his own strength.
<BBE> behold, I put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if dew shall be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said.
<BBE> Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until there was not enough strength in them to weep.
<BBE> And the men of Israel were called together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.
<BBE> So Jesse made Shammah pass before Samuel, but he said, "Yahweh also has not chosen this one."
<BBE> Now he went out from the city of Bethlehem, and desired to sojourn wheresoever he should find it convenient for him. And when he was come to mount Ephraim, as he was on his journey, and had turned aside a little into the house of Michas,
<BBE> Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
<BBE> And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
<BBE> Looking on Jesus, the author and finisher of faith, who having joy set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and now sitteth on the right hand of the throne of God.
<BBE> But if I say this to the boy, 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you;' then go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.
<BBE> And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
<BBE> And he sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying: Suffer me to pass through thy land. But he would not condescend to his request. He sent also to the king of Moab, who likewise refused to give him passage. He abode therefore in Cades,
<BBE> I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land.
<BBE> being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that  through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
<BBE> Because thou shalt conceive and bear a son, and no razor shall touch his head: for he shall be a Nazarite of God, from his infancy, and from his mother's womb, and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines.
<BBE> And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and played the harlot after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.
<BBE> And the leaders of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand sword-bearing infantry.
<BBE> By faith Joseph, as he was dying, mentioned about the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions about his bones.
<BBE> Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
<BBE> And Abigail hasteth, and taketh two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep, prepared, and five measures of roasted corn, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and two hundred bunches of figs, and setteth  on the asses.
<BBE> And the gold mice according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines, for their five rulers, from the fortified city to the unwalled village of the open country as far as the great stone, where they set the ark of Yahweh until this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.
<BBE> David had also taken Ahinoam of Jizreel; and they became, even both of them, his wives.
<BBE> from time to time the daughters of Israel go to talk to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite, four days in a year.
<BBE> Therefore, since we are receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us be thankful, through which let us serve God acceptably, with awe and reverence.
<BBE> And he saith unto them, `Thus and thus hath Micah done to me; and he hireth me, and I am to him for a priest.'
<BBE> Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.
<BBE> But they forgot Yahweh their God, so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the hosts of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
<BBE> And the guards saw a man come forth out of the city, and said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, how  may enter into the city, and we will shew thee kindness.
<BBE> He took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag which he had. His sling was in his hand; and he came near to the Philistine.
<BBE> Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
<BBE> but to Hannah he used to give a double portion, for he loved Hannah; but Jehovah had shut up her womb.
<BBE> and I see that thou art not a saviour, and I put my life in my hand, and pass over unto the Bene-Ammon, and Jehovah giveth them into my hand -- and why have ye come up unto me this day to fight against me?'
<BBE> And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, when Ehud was dead.
<BBE> And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
<BBE> There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
<BBE> Then the children of Israel put away Baalim and Astaroth, and served the Lord only.
<BBE> And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
<BBE> The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went with the people.
<BBE> The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; then the ambushers spread out, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.
<BBE> And he refuseth, and saith, `I do not eat;' and his servants urge on him, and also the woman, and he hearkeneth to their voice, and riseth from the earth, and sitteth on the bed.
<BBE> And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
<BBE> And Jehovah will also give Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me; the army of Israel also will Jehovah give into the hand of the Philistines.
<BBE> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Persuade thy husband, that he may explain to us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire. Have ye invited us to impoverish us,—is it not ?
<BBE> So God that day humbled Jabin the king of Chanaan before the children of Israel:
<BBE> And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
<BBE> And the children of Israel said to the Lord: We have sinned, do thou unto us whatsoever pleaseth thee: only deliver us this time.
<BBE> And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
<BBE> A man of Benjamin ran out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with dirt on his head.
<BBE> And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.
<BBE> Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
<BBE> For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,
<BBE> The mountains trembled before Yahweh, this Sinai, at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
<BBE> But to Anna he gave one portion with sorrow, because he loved Anna. And the Lord had shut up her womb.
<BBE> although I could have confidence even in the flesh. If anyone else thinks to put confidence in the flesh, I can do so more:
<BBE> Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.
<BBE> That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
<BBE> And when their fathers and their brethren shall come, and shall begin to complain against you, and to chide, we will say to them: Have pity on them for they took them not away as by the right of war or conquest, but when they asked to have them, you gave them not, and the fault was committed on your part.
<BBE> And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
<BBE> And when David's servants came, they spoke to Nabal all these words in David's name: and then held their peace.
<BBE> For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holies by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.

<BBE> And Hannah prayeth, and saith: `My heart hath exulted in Jehovah, My horn hath been high in Jehovah, My mouth hath been large over mine enemies, For I have rejoiced in Thy salvation.
<BBE> to those who were in Aroer, to those who were in Siphmoth, to those who were in Eshtemoa,
<BBE> And Samuel said, Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
<BBE> David said to Saul, "Your servant was keeping his father's sheep; and when a lion or a bear came, and took a lamb out of the flock,
<BBE> And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child.
<BBE> Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, "If you are returning to Yahweh with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts to Yahweh, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."
<BBE> Saul said, "You are blessed by Yahweh; for you have had compassion on me.
<BBE> He broke down the tower of Penuel, and he killed the men of the city.
<BBE> And she said, The glory is departed from Israel, for the ark of God is taken.
<BBE> They said: We will not kill thee: but we will deliver thee up bound. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him from the rock Etam.
<BBE> And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?
<BBE> and you have risen up against my father's house today, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);
<BBE> So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.
<BBE> and his concubine, who  in Shechem, hath born to him -- even she -- a son, and he appointeth his name Abimelech.
<BBE> And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon.
<BBE> And he said unto his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing unto my lord, Jehovah's anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Jehovah's anointed.
<BBE> So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
<BBE> And the people told him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that smites him.
<BBE> David struck the land, and saved no man or woman alive, and took away the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned, and came to Achish.
<BBE> Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?" Saul answered, "I am very distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me, and answers me no more, by prophets, or by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do."
<BBE> In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house; I will begin and make an end.
<BBE> and all Israel and Judah love David when he is going out and coming in before them.
<BBE> Then sang Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, on that day, saying,
<BBE> The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth." He did so.
<BBE> Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today, and I wouldn't stretch out my hand against Yahweh's anointed.
<BBE> And Saul hearkeneth to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul sweareth, `Jehovah liveth -- he doth not die.'
<BBE> There was war again. David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.
<BBE> Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
<BBE> This day will Jehovah deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day unto the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
<BBE> And the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Aram Naharaim; and the Israelites served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years.
<BBE> Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.
<BBE> He will take your daughters as his perfume makers and as cooks and as bakers.
<BBE> Without covetousness the behaviour, being content with the things present, for He hath said, `No, I will not leave, no, nor forsake thee,'
<BBE> Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
<BBE> If the man said to him, "Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires"; then he would say, "No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force."
<BBE> David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying: Wilt thou not answer, Abner? And Abner answering, said: Who art thou, that criest, and disturbest the king?
<BBE> but ye did well, having communicated with my tribulation;
<BBE> But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, "Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to Greet our master; and he insulted them.
<BBE> And she called the child Ichabod, saying: The glory is gone from Israel, because the ark of God was taken, and for her father in law, and her husband:
<BBE> But if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord, but rebel against the commandment of the Lord, then shall the hand of the Lord be against you, as it was against your fathers.
<BBE> And Saul did not look on David with a good eye from that day and forward.
<BBE> And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem; and the citizens of Shechem put confidence in him.
<BBE> Then Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" And Saul said, "I am in distress! For the Philistines are about to make war against me, but God has turned away from me, and he does not answer me any more, not by the prophets or by the dreams. So I called to you to let me know what I should do."
<BBE> Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited.
<BBE> And the trees said unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
<BBE> Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.
<BBE> And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
<BBE> The Lord therefore left all these nations, and would not quickly destroy them, neither did he deliver them into the hands of Josue.
<BBE> because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.
<BBE> Then Michal took the household god and put it on the bed and put a quilt of goat's hair at its head and covered it with the clothes.
<BBE> David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, on the way to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.
<BBE> Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his clothing, even including his sword, his bow, and his sash.

<BBE> Now the ark of Yahweh had been in the territory of the Philistines for seven months,
<BBE> And they sent messengers to all the tribe of Benjamin to say to them: Why hath so great an abomination been found among you?
<BBE> And the spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to Ascalon, and slew there thirty men, whose garments he took away and gave to them that had declared the riddle. And being exceeding angry he went up to his father's house:
<BBE> because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also,
<BBE> and `their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more;'
<BBE> Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?
<BBE> The children of Israel also returned by their tribes, and families, to their dwellings. In those days there was no king in Israel: but every one did that which seemed right to himself.
<BBE> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,
<BBE> Now David had said, "Surely in vain I guarded all that this fellow had in the desert. And nothing was missed of all that was his, but he returned evil against me in place of good!
<BBE> and of this being persuaded, I have known that I shall remain and continue with you all, to your advancement and joy of the faith,
<BBE> And Debbora said to Barac: Arise, for this is the day wherein the Lord hath delivered Sisara into thy hands: behold he is thy leader. And Barac went down from mount Thabor, and ten thousand fighting men with him.
<BBE> Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to perfection—not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,
<BBE> And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
<BBE> For rebellion is like the sin of divination; arrogance is like iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has rejected you from being king!"
<BBE> And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.
<BBE> And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
<BBE> Do not be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods by which those who participate have not benefited.
<BBE> For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
<BBE> And to leave the crime of the murder of the seventy sons of Jerobaal, and the shedding of their blood upon Abimelech their brother, and upon the rest of the princes of the Sichemites, who aided him.
<BBE> And Jonathan saith unto David, `Jehovah, God of Israel -- when I search my father, about  time to-morrow  the third , and lo, good  towards David, and I do not then send unto thee, and have uncovered thine ear --
<BBE> So Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh. Then the angel did an amazing thing as Manoah and his wife watched.
<BBE> And the three hundred men nevertheless persisted sounding the trumpets. And the Lord sent the sword into all the camp, and they killed one another,
<BBE> For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
<BBE> And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.
<BBE> So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily. He didn't deliver them into Joshua's hand.
<BBE> And the men of Israel turn in battle, and Benjamin hath begun to smite the wounded among the men of Israel, about thirty men, for they said, `Surely they are utterly smitten before us, as  the first battle;
<BBE> And it answered them: If indeed you mean to make me king, come ye and rest under my shadow: but if you mean it not, let fire come out from the bramble, and devour the cedars of Libanus.
<BBE> And the sons of Israel go up and weep before Jehovah till the evening, and ask of Jehovah, saying, `Do I add to draw nigh to battle with the sons of Benjamin, my brother?' And Jehovah saith, `Go up against him.'
<BBE> His son in law would not consent to his words: but forthwith went forward and came over against Jebus, which by another name is called Jerusalem, leading with him two asses laden, and his concubine.
<BBE> Now Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been located. Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree at Ramah. Now his spear was in his hand and all his servants were stationed around him.
<BBE> Also before they burnt the fat, the servant of the priest came, and said to the man that sacrificed: Give me flesh to boil for the priest: for I will not take of thee sodden flesh, but raw.
<BBE> So Samuel spoke all the words of Yahweh to the people who were requesting a king from him.
<BBE> Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in the same way with the blood.
<BBE> "Hear, you kings! Give ear, you princes! I, even I, will sing to Yahweh. I will sing praise to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
<BBE> Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.
<BBE> in order that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and patience.
<BBE> But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
<BBE> And Jephthah saith to the elders of Gilead, `Have not ye hated me? and ye cast me out from the house of my father, and wherefore have ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?'
<BBE> And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
<BBE> Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.
<BBE> Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
<BBE> Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, utter a song; Rise, Barak, and take captive thy captivity, Son of Abinoam.
<BBE> He said to him, "Don't be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father won't find you; and you will be king over Israel, and I will be next to you; and Saul my father knows that also."
<BBE> The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;
<BBE> And Jonathan saith to him, `To-morrow  new moon, and thou hast been looked after, for thy seat is looked after;
<BBE> But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:
<BBE> Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army; for the army was secure.
<BBE> In the same way God, because he wanted to show even more to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his resolve, guaranteed it with an oath,
<BBE> From that day Gedeon was called Jerobaal, because Joss had said: Let Baal revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar.
<BBE> Oh! would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.
<BBE> And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
<BBE> By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.
<BBE> And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the Lord your God was your king.
<BBE> And he said to him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, and not apprise me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.
<BBE> They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
<BBE> Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
<BBE> having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
<BBE> but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that is about to consume the adversaries.
<BBE> And when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him.
<BBE> So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
<BBE> And Samuel said to Jesse, Are these all the young men? And he said, There is yet the youngest remaining, and behold, he is feeding the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit at table till he come hither.
<BBE> for your contribution to the good news from the first day till now,
<BBE> Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
<BBE> But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
<BBE> And the people say unto Saul, `Doth Jonathan die who wrought this great salvation in Israel? -- a profanation! Jehovah liveth, if there falleth from the hair of his head to the earth, for with God he hath wrought this day;' and the people rescue Jonathan, and he hath not died.
<BBE> And the Angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the Angel of Jehovah departed out of his sight.
<BBE> And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.
<BBE> And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.
<BBE> And he went thither to Naioth by Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth by Ramah.
<BBE> Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need.

<BBE> And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.
<BBE> And Eliab, his eldest brother, heard while he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
<BBE> behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken."
<BBE> So Eli said to Samuel "Go lie down. If he calls to you, then you must say, 'Speak Yahweh, because your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
<BBE> Now there was a certain man in the wilderness of Maon, and his possessions were in Carmel, and the man was very great: and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and it happened that he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
<BBE> And the youth hath not known anything, only Jonathan and David knew the word.
<BBE> and I have raised up for Me a stedfast priest; as in My heart and in My soul he doth do; and I have built for him a stedfast house, and he hath walked up and down before Mine anointed all the days;
<BBE> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
<BBE> Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
<BBE> And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah.
<BBE> And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el; and Jehovah was with them.
<BBE> When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted from the donkey, Caleb said to her, "What do you want?"
<BBE> Then Saul commanded his servants, "Speak to David in secret, saying, 'Look, the king is pleased with you, and all his servants love you. So then, become a son-in-law of the king.'"
<BBE> And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
<BBE> Then Saul and his men went to seek him: and it was told David, and forthwith he went down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon: and when Saul had heard of it he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
<BBE> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag that he had, into the pocket; and his sling was in his hand. And he drew near to the Philistine.
<BBE> Then Saul built an altar to Yahweh; it was the first altar he built to Yahweh.
<BBE> He came up, and told his father and his mother, saying: I saw a woman in Thamnatha of the daughters of the Philistines: I beseech you, take her for me to wife.
<BBE> Then Yahweh said to Samuel, "Listen to the voice of the people concerning all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.
<BBE> And the men of Israel are called from Naphtali, and from Asher, and from all Manasseh, and pursue after Midian.

<BBE> One rock stood out towards the north over against Machmas, and the other to the south over against Gabaa.
<BBE> And Saul speaketh unto Jonathan his son, and unto all his servants, to put David to death,
<BBE> in order that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge may have powerful encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us,
<BBE> (for they are become priests without the swearing of an oath, but he with the swearing of an oath, by him who said, as to him, The Lord has sworn, and will not repent [of it], *Thou*  priest for ever [according to the order of Melchisedec];)
<BBE> And Saul sware to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
<BBE> For whom the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives."
<BBE> She fastened it with the pin and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And Samson woke up from his sleep and tore loose the loom pin of the web and the warp-threads.
<BBE> But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.
<BBE> And he put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the Lord wrought great salvation for all Israel. Thou sawest it and didst rejoice. Why therefore wilt thou sin against innocent blood by killing David, who is without fault?
<BBE> And Saul said to the Cinite: Go, depart and get ye down from Amalec: lest I destroy thee with him. For thou hast shewn kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. And the Cinite departed from the midst of Amalec.
<BBE> And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.
<BBE> And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
<BBE> I beg of Evodia, and I beseech Syntyche, to be of one mind in the Lord.
<BBE> I pray thee, forgive the transgression of thy handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a lasting house; because my lord fights the battles of Jehovah, and evil has not been found in thee all thy days.
<BBE> And do not neglect doing good and generosity, for God is pleased with such sacrifices.
<BBE> Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, and that went up with them into the camp, from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
<BBE> and all Israel go down to the Philistines, to sharpen each his ploughshare, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock;
<BBE> Then David said, "Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?" Yahweh said, "They will deliver you up."
<BBE> But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.
<BBE> I can do all these things in him who strengtheneth me.
<BBE> Calling the name of the city Dan after the name of their father, who was the son of Israel, which before was called Lais.
<BBE> And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and the Lord was with him.
<BBE> For they did not endure that which was said: And if so much as a beast shall touch the mount, it shall be stoned.
<BBE> And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
<BBE> and he told her all his heart, and said to her, There has not come a razor upon my head; for I am a Nazarite of God from my mother's womb; if I should be shaven, then my strength would go from me, and I should be weak, and be like all mankind.
<BBE> and to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David had gone up and down, he and his men.
<BBE> And six hundred men from the descendants of Dan, armed with their weapons of war, were standing at the entrance of the gate.
<BBE> In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
<BBE> And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
<BBE> Is the wheat harvest not today? I will call out to Yahweh so that he still sends thunder and rain, so that you will know and will see that your wickedness is great that you have done in the eyes of Yahweh by asking for a king for yourselves."
<BBE> And they turned aside there to enter and to spend the night at Gibeah. And they went and sat in the open square of the city, but no one took them in to spend the night.
<BBE> And when the people were come unto the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.
<BBE> Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of his glory, according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue all things unto himself.
<BBE> And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
<BBE> And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
<BBE> And I will shoot three arrows near it, and will shoot as if I were exercising myself at a mark.
<BBE> So Saul's uncle said to him, "Please tell me, what did Samuel say to you?"
<BBE> but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;
<BBE> And he gave them a thorough beating, and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
<BBE> And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
<BBE> And David said to Achimelech the priest: The king hath commanded me a business, and said: Let no man know the thing for which thou art sent by me, and what manner of commands I have given thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.
<BBE> See, may ye not refuse him who is speaking, for if those did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely speaking -- much less we who do turn away from him who  from heaven,
<BBE> And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
<BBE> And so then, listen to their voice. However, you must earnestly warn them; you must explain to them the custom of the king who will rule over them."
<BBE> If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
<BBE> The five rulers of the Philistines saw it and returned to Ekron that same day.
<BBE> And an angel of the Lord went up from Galgal to the place of weepers, and said: I made you go out of Egypt, and have brought you into the land for which I swore to your fathers: and I promised that I would not make void my covenant with you for ever:
<BBE> And Abdon the son of Hillel, the Pirathonite, died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekites.
<BBE> When Yahweh sent you on your way, he said to you: 'Go! You must utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and you must fight against them until you have destroyed them.'
<BBE> Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, "Send me David your son, who is with the sheep."
<BBE> And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.
<BBE> And between the passages where Jonathan sought to pass over unto the station of the Philistines  the edge of a rock on the one side, and the edge of a rock on the other side, and the name of the one is Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
<BBE> and you will hear what they say; and afterward you will have courage, and you will go down against the camp." Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outpost of the armed men that were in the camp.
<BBE> Now they told David, "Look, the Philistines are fighting in Keilah and they are raiding the threshing floors."
<BBE> and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, hath paid tithes,
<BBE> And they went up into the city. And when they were walking in the midst of the city, behold Samuel was coming out over against them, to go up to the high place.
<BBE> And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul. And he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David played with his hand.
<BBE> and to those in Aroer, and to those in Siphmoth, and to those in Eshtemoa,
<BBE> David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty.
<BBE> Now in the things which we are saying the chief point is this: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
<BBE> For a testament is of force where there hath been death: for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth.
<BBE> And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
<BBE> And the Amorrhite straitened the children of Dan in the mountain, and gave them not place to go down to the plain:
<BBE> Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.
<BBE> There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.
<BBE> And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and unto the Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.
<BBE> Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.
<BBE> And when this was told Saul, he sent other messengers: but they also prophesied. And again Saul sent messengers the third time: and they prophesied also. And Saul being exceedingly angry,
<BBE> So from that day and beyond, he made it a rule and a regulation for Israel until this day.
<BBE> Now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth not to bring with it joy, but sorrow: but afterwards it will yield, to them that are exercised by it, the most peaceable fruit of justice.
<BBE> And he said to them, "Micah did such and such for me and hired me, and I became his priest."
<BBE> And without all contradiction, that which is less, is blessed by the better.
<BBE> Now there was a man from Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjaminite, a very wealthy man.
<BBE> `And Israel sendeth messengers unto Sihon, king of the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and Israel saith to him, Let us pass over, we pray thee, through thy land, unto my place,
<BBE> So her husband Elkanah said to her, "Do what seems right to you; stay until you wean him. Only may Yahweh fulfill his word." So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.
<BBE> David said to his men, "Every man put on his sword!" Every man put on his sword. David also put on his sword. About four hundred men followed David, and two hundred stayed by the baggage.
<BBE> When Jehovah hath looked after Hannah, then she conceiveth and beareth three sons and two daughters; and the youth Samuel groweth up with Jehovah.
<BBE> And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
<BBE> And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah gave them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
<BBE> but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.
<BBE> Then Saul said to his uncle, "He told us for certain that the female donkeys had been found." But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingship of which Samuel had spoken.
<BBE> But his wife said to him, "If Yahweh wanted to kill us he would not have taken from our hand the burnt offering and the grain offering, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us things such as these."
<BBE> And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
<BBE> But Saul said nothing on that day, for he thought, "Something happened to him. He is not ceremonially clean; surely he is not clean."
<BBE> But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have trained their faculties for the distinguishing of both good and evil.
<BBE> Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke; and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;
<BBE> But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;
<BBE> But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and, behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven.
<BBE> And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.
<BBE> Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and Samuel was told, saying, "Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal."
<BBE> Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
<BBE> Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.
<BBE> His friend answered him and said, "This cannot be anything except the sword of Gideon son of Jehoash, a man of Israel; God has given Midian and the entire camp into his hand."
<BBE> To him succeeded Jair the Galaadite, who judged Israel for two and twenty years.
<BBE> For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, wherein were the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the Holy place.
<BBE> Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers-in-wait was, that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.
<BBE> And he returned to Ramatha, for there was his house, and there he judged Israel: he built also there an altar to the Lord.
<BBE> For the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from God:
<BBE> Delilah realized that he had confided in her, so she sent and called the rulers of the Philistines, saying, "Come up one more time, for he has confided in me." And the rulers of the Philistines came up, and they brought the money with them.
<BBE> And Samuel speaketh unto the people the right of the kingdom, and writeth in a book, and placeth before Jehovah; and Samuel sendeth all the people away, each to his house.
<BBE> Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to Yahweh. Samuel cried to Yahweh for Israel; and Yahweh answered him.
<BBE> And the Philistines gather all their camps to Aphek, and the Israelites are encamping at a fountain which  in Jezreel,
<BBE> And thou shalt build an altar to the Lord thy God in the top of this rock, whereupon thou didst lay the sacrifice before: and thou shalt take the second bullock, and shalt offer a holocaust upon a pile of the wood, which thou shalt cut down out of the grove.
<BBE> But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.
<BBE> He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they were also called to follow him; and he sent messengers throughout Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them.
<BBE> Then David ran, stood over the Philistine, took his sword, drew it out of its sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
<BBE> And David said, "Yahweh, who rescued me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear, will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine!" Then Saul said to David, "Go and may Yahweh be with you!"
<BBE> And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
<BBE> And a man of the people answereth and saith, `Thy father certainly adjured the people, saying, Cursed  the man who eateth food to-day; and the people are weary.'
<BBE> Take courage and behave like men, ye Philistines: lest you come to be servants to the Hebrews, as they have served you: take courage and fight.
<BBE> But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.
<BBE> The Philistine walked and came near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.
<BBE> By faith he celebrated the pasch, and the shedding of the blood; that he, who destroyed the firstborn, might not touch them.
<BBE> And he said unto him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
<BBE> And Abimelech pursued him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, as far as the entrance of the gate.
<BBE> And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.
<BBE> And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.
<BBE> And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
<BBE> Then I said, 'Behold, I have come— in the roll of the book it is written about me— to do your will, O God.'
<BBE> By faith Abraham, being called, did obey, to go forth to the place that he was about to receive for an inheritance, and he went forth, not knowing whither he doth go;
<BBE> Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.
<BBE> And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
<BBE> And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.
<BBE> By faith Joseph, when his end was nigh, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
<BBE> And God clave the hallow rock which was in Lehi, and water came out of it. And he drank, and his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore its name was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.
<BBE> Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.
<BBE> These are the nations that Yahweh left, to test Israel by them (that is, to test all those who had not experienced any of the wars of Canaan,
<BBE> Then Saul said to his servant, "Well said. Come, let us go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.
<BBE> And his armourbearer said to him: Do all that pleaseth thy mind: go whither thou wilt, and I will be with thee wheresoever thou hast a mind.
<BBE> And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.
<BBE> And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.
<BBE> Then Jerobaal, who is the same as Gedeon, rising up early and all the people with him, came to the fountain that is called Harad. Now the camp of Madian was in the valley on the north side of the high hill.
<BBE> And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
<BBE> His armor bearer said to him, "Do all that is in your heart. Turn and, behold, I am with you according to your heart."
<BBE> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,
<BBE> And now the king goeth before you: but I am old and greyheaded: and my sons are with you: having then conversed with you from my youth unto this day, behold here I am.
<BBE> And Manoah saith unto the messenger of Jehovah, `Let us detain thee, we pray thee, and prepare before thee a kid of the goats.'
<BBE> And when the messengers were come in, they found an image upon the bed, and a goat's skin at its head.
<BBE> and the women answer -- those playing, and say, `Saul hath smitten among his thousands, And David among his myriads.'
<BBE> Then David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army. Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him.
<BBE> They ran and got him there. When he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
<BBE> He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, "Where are you going? Where did you come from?"
<BBE> And he said, What is the thing that Jehovah hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.
<BBE> then this will not be an obstacle for you or a stumbling block of conscience for my lord either by the shedding of blood without cause or by my lord taking matters into his own hands. And when Yahweh does good to my lord, then remember your female servant."
<BBE> When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.
<BBE> And Jehovah said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
<BBE> And Saul answereth and saith, `Am not I a Benjamite -- of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? and why hast thou spoken unto me according to this word?'
<BBE> Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was buried in the cities of Gilead.
<BBE> But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.
<BBE> By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with them that were disobedient, having received the spies with peace.
<BBE> And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.
<BBE> And David saith unto Achish, `If, I pray thee, I have found grace in thine eyes, they give to me a place in one of the cities of the field, and I dwell there, yea, why doth thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?'
<BBE> And Saul saith, `Be ye scattered among the people, and ye have said to them, Bring ye nigh unto me each his ox, and each his sheep; and ye have slain  in this place, and eaten, and ye do not sin against Jehovah to eat with the blood.' And all the people bring nigh each his ox, in his hand, that night, and slaughter  there.
<BBE> Then Abimelech departing from thence came to the town of Thebes, which he surrounded and besieged with his army.
<BBE> And they shall not teach each his fellow-citizen, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; because all shall know me in themselves, from  little one [among them] unto  great among them.
<BBE> Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.

<BBE> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the Lord had shut up her womb.
<BBE> And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.
<BBE> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me of a certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.
<BBE> Asher did not dispossess the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor Ahlab, nor Achzib, nor Helbah, nor Aphik, nor Rehob;
<BBE> All the people likewise each cut down his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them at the base of the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
<BBE> Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because Jehovah has anointed thee prince over his inheritance?
<BBE> And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
<BBE> And the two months being expired, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed, and she knew no man. From thence came a fashion in Israel, and a custom has been kept:
<BBE> Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever! Amen.
<BBE> Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
<BBE> and Jonathan addeth to cause David to swear, because he loveth him, for with the love of his own soul he hath loved him.
<BBE> And Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony to the things that would be spoken,
<BBE> Wherefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father should minister in my sight, for ever. But now saith the Lord: Far be this from me: but whosoever shall glorify me, him will I glorify: but they that despise me, shall be despised.
<BBE> As he did so year by year, when she went up to Yahweh's house. Her rival provoked her; therefore she wept, and didn't eat.
<BBE> Thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in that he hath subjected all things to him, he left nothing not subject to him. But now we see not as yet all things subject to him.
<BBE> Isn't it wheat harvest today? I will call to Yahweh, that he may send thunder and rain; and you will know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in Yahweh's sight, in asking for a king."
<BBE> And he stood and cried to the ranks of Israel, and said to them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I the Philistine, and ye servants of Saul? choose for yourselves a man, and let him come down to me.
<BBE> Nevertheless you have done well by sharing with me in my affliction.
<BBE> But a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech's head and cracked open his skull.
<BBE> Therefore, receiving a Kingdom that can't be shaken, let us have grace, through which we serve God acceptably, with reverence and awe,
<BBE> And David saith unto Achish, `Therefore -- thou dost know that which thy servant dost do.' And Achish saith unto David, `Therefore -- keeper of my head I do appoint thee all the days.'
<BBE> Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed to Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.
<BBE> And it came to pass about a month after this that Naas, the Ammonite came up, and began to fight against Jabes Galaad. And all the men of Jabes said to Naas: Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
<BBE> but he said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and don't eat any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.'"
<BBE> for, Jehovah liveth, who is saving Israel: surely if it be in Jonathan my son, surely he doth certainly die;' and none is answering him out of all the people.
<BBE> And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
<BBE> So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armour-bearer, and all his men, that same day together.
<BBE> And all Israel did hear, saying, "Saul has defeated the garrison of the Philistines; and also, Israel has become a stench among the Philistines!" So the people were called out after Saul at Gilgal.
<BBE> And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
<BBE> Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces. He will thunder against them in the sky. "Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed."
<BBE> Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
<BBE> They abandoned Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
<BBE> The men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as Gai and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and to Ekron.
<BBE> and Jael goeth out to meet Sisera, and saith unto him, `Turn aside, my lord, turn aside unto me, fear not;' and he turneth aside unto her, into the tent, and she covereth him with a coverlet.
<BBE> Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. When they attacked Ziklag, they burned it with fire.
<BBE> Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for he is such a worthless fellow, that one cannot speak to him.
<BBE> and thou hast done kindness, to thy servant, for into a covenant of Jehovah thou hast brought thy servant with thee; -- and if there is in me iniquity, put thou me to death; and unto thy father, why is this -- thou dost bring me in?'
<BBE> For finding fault with them, he said, "Behold, the days come", says the Lord, "that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
<BBE> And the priests' custom with the people was, when any man sacrificed a sacrifice, the priest's servant came, when the flesh was cooked, with a flesh-hook of three prongs in his hand;
<BBE> So the elders of the congregation said, "What should we do for the remaining ones for wives, since the women from Benjamin have been destroyed?"
<BBE> And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.
<BBE> Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.
<BBE> But I will raise up for myself a reliable priest; he will do just according to what is in my heart and in my soul. I will build for him a lasting house and he will walk continually before my anointed one forever.
<BBE> You made him for a short time lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor;
<BBE> And Saul consulted the Lord: Shall I pursue after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hands of Israel? And he answered him not that day.
<BBE> But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For God does not see what man sees, for a man looks on the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks on the heart."
<BBE> His concubine who was in Shechem also bore for him a son, and he named him Abimelech.
<BBE> And the Philistines are afraid, for they said, `God hath come in unto the camp;' and they say, `Wo to us, for there hath not been like this heretofore.
<BBE> Samson called to Yahweh, and said, "Lord Yahweh, remember me, please, and strengthen me, please, only this once, God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes."
<BBE> Then Eli called Samuel, and said, "Samuel, my son!" He said, "Here I am."
<BBE> Then she brought him up with her when she had weaned him, along with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She brought him to the house of Yahweh at Shiloh while the boy was still young.
<BBE> And Jehovah saith to him, `Peace to thee; fear not; thou dost not die.'
<BBE> And Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and oxen, and beasts of the second bearing, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not devote them to destruction; but everything that was mean and weak, that they destroyed utterly.
<BBE> Like all the deeds they have done from the day I brought them up from Egypt until this day, they have forsaken me and have served other gods—so they are doing to you also.
<BBE> And he inquired of Jehovah for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
<BBE> And now proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is timid and afraid, let him go back and turn from mount Gilead. And there went back of the people twenty-two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
<BBE> But he rising up began to be for departing. And nevertheless his father in law earnestly pressed him, and made him stay with him.
<BBE> extinguished the effectiveness of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong from weakness, became mighty in battle, put to flight enemy battle lines.
<BBE> And again, the Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. They served the Baals, the Ashtaroth, the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab, and the gods of the Ammonites and Philistines; they abandoned Yahweh and did not serve him.
<BBE> And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.
<BBE> And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
<BBE> For it is impossible concerning those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and become sharers of the Holy Spirit,
<BBE> That you may approve the better things, that you may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ,
<BBE> Now the children of Israel had given a sign to them, whom they had laid in ambushes, that after they had taken the city, they should make a fire: that by the smoke rising on high, they might shew that the city was taken.
<BBE> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
<BBE> Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto Jehovah; I will sing praise to Jehovah, the God of Israel.
<BBE> And they came to the foresaid hill, and behold a company of prophets met him: and the spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he prophesied in the midst of them.
<BBE> But you have today rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, 'No! Set a king over us.' Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes, and by your thousands."
<BBE> But a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Hurry and come, because the Philistines have made a raid on the land!"
<BBE> And Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
<BBE> Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth and groweth old, is near its end.
<BBE> For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
<BBE> Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David; they had left them behind at the Wadi Besor. They went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. David came near with the people and asked them how they were doing.
<BBE> Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
<BBE> And Judah went up; and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they smote them in Bezek, ten thousand men.
<BBE> When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, "What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?" They understood that Yahweh's ark had come into the camp.
<BBE> And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
<BBE> And Jonathan said to David, Jehovah, God of Israel, when I sound my father about this time to-morrow,  the next day, and behold, there be good toward David, and I then send not to thee, and apprise thee of it,
<BBE> And the men of David say unto him, `Lo, the day of which Jehovah said unto thee, Lo, I am giving thine enemy into thy hand, and thou hast done to him as it is good in thine eyes;' and David riseth and cutteth off the skirt of the upper robe which  on Saul -- gently.
<BBE> Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly, that now at length your thought for me hath flourished again, as you did also think; but you were busied.
<BBE> not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom  with some; but encouraging [one another], and by so much the more as ye see the day drawing near.
<BBE> Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy companions.
<BBE> And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him.
<BBE> And Samuel took a sucking-lamb, and offered it as a whole burnt-offering to Jehovah; and Samuel cried to Jehovah for Israel, and Jehovah answered him.
<BBE> While Saul talked to the priest, the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand!"
<BBE> And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son-in-law, Strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.
<BBE> But I would have you know, brethren, that the circumstances in which I am have turned out rather to the furtherance of the glad tidings,
<BBE> And he said to them, Thus and thus has Micah done to me; and he has hired me, and I am his priest.
<BBE> And the servants of Saul speak in the ears of David these words, and David saith, `Is it a light thing in your eyes to be son-in-law to the king -- and I a poor man, and lightly esteemed?'
<BBE> And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.
<BBE> Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he put them to the worse.
<BBE> And the men of Israel say unto Gideon, `Rule over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, for thou hast saved us from the hand of Midian.'
<BBE> and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
<BBE> For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from smiting the kings, and blessed him;
<BBE> For all seek the things that are their own; not the things that are Jesus Christ's.
<BBE> And it hath been, when she multiplied praying before Jehovah, that Eli is watching her mouth,
<BBE> Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" One said, "Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah."
<BBE> And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.
<BBE> And Jehovah saith unto Gideon, `Yet  the people too many; bring them down unto the water, and I refine it for thee there; and it hath been, he of whom I say unto thee, This doth go with thee -- he doth go with thee; and any of whom I say unto thee, This doth not go with thee -- he doth not go.'
<BBE> And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.
<BBE> And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
<BBE> And he came to Soccoth and said to them: Behold Zebee and Salmana, concerning whom you upbraided me, saying: Peradventure the hands of Zebee and Salmana, are in thy hands, and therefore thou demandest that we should give bread to the men that are weary and faint.
<BBE> Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Sechu; and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, at Naioth by Ramah.
<BBE> For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on.
<BBE> Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt.
<BBE> Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God:
<BBE> And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
<BBE> They said to him, "Please ask counsel of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous."
<BBE> Now therefore, don't let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains."
<BBE> And that man hath gone up out of his city from time to time, to bow himself, and to sacrifice, before Jehovah of Hosts, in Shiloh, and there  two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Jehovah.
<BBE> And it came to pass afterwards that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
<BBE> By faith Moses, when he was grown up, denied himself to be the son of Pharao's daughter;
<BBE> But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;
<BBE> For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.
<BBE> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
<BBE> Saul said, "No man shall be put to death today; for today Yahweh has rescued Israel."
<BBE> And he said to Heli: I am he that came from the battle, and have fled out of the field this day. And he said to him: What is there done, my son?
<BBE> Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
<BBE> Remember them that had the rule over you, men that spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith.
<BBE> Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
<BBE> Them other of Sisera looketh out at the window, And crieth through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the trampings of his chariots?
<BBE> And see, my father, yes, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand. For in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou liest in wait for my life to take it.
<BBE> And David said to Achish, Therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of my head for ever.
<BBE> Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
<BBE> And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
<BBE> And David said, Jehovah who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and Jehovah be with thee.
<BBE> And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
<BBE> And Saul caught up a spear to strike him. And Jonathan understood that it was determined by his father to kill David.
<BBE> When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, "Abner, whose son is this youth?" Abner said, "As your soul lives, O king, I can't tell."
<BBE> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.
<BBE> and the people pounced on the plunder, and took sheep, cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.
<BBE> The land had rest forty years, then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
<BBE> And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
<BBE> With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
<BBE> And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
<BBE> Then all the ancients of Israel being assembled, came to Samuel to Ramatha.
<BBE> I will raise me up a faithful priest, that will do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house; and he will walk before my anointed forever.
<BBE> And when they sounded their trumpets in three places round about the camp, and had broken their pitchers, they held their lamps in their left hands, and with their right hands the trumpets which they blew, and they cried out: The sword of the Lord and of Gedeon;
<BBE> And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and spake with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
<BBE> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:
<BBE> But if you will still do wickedly: both you and your king shall perish together.
<BBE> And blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you who have prevented me this day from bloodguilt and from delivering myself by my own hand.
<BBE> And the ravagers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned the way of Ophrah, into the land of Shual;
<BBE> And the Philistines gather their camps to battle, and are gathered to Shochoh, which  to Judah, and encamp between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-Dammim;
<BBE> They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.
<BBE> When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, "Behold, a present for you from the plunder of Yahweh's enemies."
<BBE> And the woman saith, `Whom do I bring up to thee?' and he saith, `Samuel -- bring up to me.'
<BBE> From the day the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, days multiplied and became twenty years while all the house of Israel mourned after Yahweh.
<BBE> To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him prince over my people Israel; and he will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.
<BBE> Then he fled and avoided them and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered to him needy men, and robbers, and they followed him as their prince.
<BBE> Yahweh's angel came up from Gilgal to Bochim. He said, "I brought you out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to give your fathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you.
<BBE> But the children of Belial said: Shall this fellow be able to save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents, but he dissembled as though he heard not.
<BBE> And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
<BBE> And he is speaking with them, and lo, a man of the duellists is coming up, Goliath the Philistine  his name, of Gath, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and he speaketh according to those words, and David heareth;
<BBE> and ye -- ye have forsaken Me, and serve other gods, therefore I add not to save you.
<BBE> Then Saul said to his armourbearer: Draw thy sword, and kill me: lest these uncircumcised come, and slay me, and mock at me. And his armourbearer would not: for he was struck with exceeding great fear. Then Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.
<BBE> And now they were come near Jebus, and the day was far spent: and the servant said to his master: Come, I beseech thee, let us turn into the city of the Jebusites, and lodge there.
<BBE> Then Saul said to his servant, "But, behold, if we go, what should we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our sacks, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?"
<BBE> And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.
<BBE> From the day that the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, the time was long; for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh.
<BBE> After him was Samgar the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with a ploughshare: and he also defended Israel.
<BBE> And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.
<BBE> And David goeth out whithersoever Saul doth send him; he acted wisely, and Saul setteth him over the men of war, and it is good in the eyes of all the people, and also in the eyes of the servants of Saul.
<BBE> And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, Bring near to me, I pray thee, the ephod. And Abiathar brought the ephod near to David.
<BBE> so that we do boldly say, `The Lord  to me a helper, and I will not fear what man shall do to me.'
<BBE> And she saith to her young men, `Pass over before me; lo, after you I am coming;' and to her husband Nabal she hath not declared ;
<BBE> And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
<BBE> reckoning that even out of the dead God is able to raise up, whence also in a figure he did receive .
<BBE> So he brought them before the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the days David was in the stronghold.
<BBE> And the king said unto the guard that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of Jehovah; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of Jehovah.
<BBE> Gaal the son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn't he the son of Jerubbaal? Isn't Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem, but why should we serve him?
<BBE> Into your hands hath God delivered the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their spirit was appeased toward him, when he said that word.
<BBE> So they sent ten thousand of the most valiant men, and commanded them, saying: Go and put the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad to the sword, with their wives and their children.
<BBE> To whom also Abraham divided the tithes of all: who first indeed by interpretation, is king of justice: and then also king of Salem, that is, king of peace:
<BBE> Then Saul said, "Come here, all you leaders of the people, so that we find out what the sin was this day.
<BBE> The children of Israel said to Yahweh, "We have sinned! Do you to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us, please, today."
<BBE> and Jonathan calleth after the youth, `Speed, haste, stand not;' and Jonathan's youth gathereth the arrows, and cometh unto his lord.
<BBE> Achish answered David, "I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God. Notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.'
<BBE> neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.
<BBE> And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.
<BBE> And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,
<BBE> And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines which was in Gabaa. And when the Philistines had heard of it, Saul sounded the trumpet over all the land, saying: Let the Hebrews hear.
<BBE> The servant again answered Saul and said, "Look, I have in my hand a quarter shekel of silver! I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us our way."
<BBE> for those in Hebron, and for all the places where David and his men had roamed.
<BBE> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay; At her feet he bowed, he fell: Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
<BBE> And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away; and what have I more? and what is this that ye say to me, What aileth thee?
<BBE> And, now, take heed, I pray thee, and do not drink wine, and strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing,
<BBE> and he, because of his remaining -- to the age, hath the priesthood not transient,
<BBE> and ye do not turn aside after the vain things which do not profit nor deliver, for they  vain,
<BBE> having reasoned that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which he received him back also as a symbol.
<BBE> Remember them that are in bands, as if you were bound with them; and them that labour, as being yourselves also in the body.
<BBE> And Samuel spoke all the words of Jehovah to the people that asked of him a king.
<BBE> For a will is in force concerning those who are dead, since it is never in force when the one who made the will is alive.
<BBE> And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
