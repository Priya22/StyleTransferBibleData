<ASV> And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.

<ASV> And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
<ASV> What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
<ASV> And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
<ASV> For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.

<ASV> And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
<ASV> And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
<ASV> There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
<ASV> Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
<ASV> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?

<ASV> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the Lord: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
<ASV> And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?
<ASV> Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
<ASV> Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
<ASV> And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
<ASV> And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.
<ASV> So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,
<ASV> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
<ASV> And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
<ASV> And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.
<ASV> To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<ASV> And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
<ASV> And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.

<ASV> But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.

<ASV> And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
<ASV> For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
<ASV> In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.
<ASV> And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
<ASV> And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
<ASV> And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.
<ASV> And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
<ASV> And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.
<ASV> And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
<ASV> Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.

<ASV> Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the Lord, that he might perform his saying, which the Lord spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
<ASV> And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass.
<ASV> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.
<ASV> And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:
<ASV> As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:
<ASV> And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
<ASV> And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.

<ASV> And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
<ASV> And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
<ASV> And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the Lord: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,
<ASV> And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.
<ASV> And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
<ASV> And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.
<ASV> And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.
<ASV> And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
<ASV> And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.
<ASV> And they brought up the ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.
<ASV> But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
<ASV> And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the Lord, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
<ASV> And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
<ASV> And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
<ASV> Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
<ASV> And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
<ASV> Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
<ASV> And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.
<ASV> And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,
<ASV> And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.

<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
<ASV> And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.
<ASV> And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

<ASV> Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,
<ASV> And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.
<ASV> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
<ASV> I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
<ASV> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the Lord God of my lord the king say so too.
<ASV> And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.

<ASV> And the Lord said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:
<ASV> The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan:
<ASV> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
<ASV> And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
<ASV> And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
<ASV> For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.
<ASV> And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
<ASV> And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.
<ASV> (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
<ASV> And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
<ASV> I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.
<ASV> And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:
<ASV> And all the city was gathered together at the door.
<ASV> All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
<ASV> Then king Solomon sware by the Lord, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.
<ASV> For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.

<ASV> And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
<ASV> Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.

<ASV> For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
<ASV> For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
<ASV> And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
<ASV> And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.
<ASV> Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.
<ASV> And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
<ASV> With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.
<ASV> Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?
<ASV> And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
<ASV> Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
<ASV> Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.
<ASV> And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
<ASV> And Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord, and went not fully after the Lord, as did David his father.
<ASV> And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.
<ASV> And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
<ASV> He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.
<ASV> And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.
<ASV> So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
<ASV> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
<ASV> And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:
<ASV> So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
<ASV> And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.
<ASV> And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.
<ASV> Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.
<ASV> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
<ASV> And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
<ASV> But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
<ASV> And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
<ASV> And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
<ASV> And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
<ASV> And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
<ASV> Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
<ASV> Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.
<ASV> And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
<ASV> And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.
<ASV> And the Lord hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.
<ASV> And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
<ASV> And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
<ASV> And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
<ASV> For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.
<ASV> And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
<ASV> Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.

<ASV> But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
<ASV> And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
<ASV> And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
<ASV> And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
<ASV> And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:
<ASV> The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
<ASV> Therefore now, Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
<ASV> So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
<ASV> For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
<ASV> And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
<ASV> And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the Lord, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the Lord. So he finished the house.
<ASV> For the saying which he cried by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
<ASV> And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
<ASV> Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
<ASV> So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
<ASV> And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
<ASV> And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
<ASV> In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:
<ASV> So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.
<ASV> And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.
<ASV> And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
<ASV> Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.
<ASV> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
<ASV> So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.
<ASV> And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
<ASV> Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.
