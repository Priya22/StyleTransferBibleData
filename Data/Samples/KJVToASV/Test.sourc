<ASV> But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
<ASV> If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them.
<ASV> And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
<ASV> But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.

<ASV> And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,
<ASV> And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.
<ASV> And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?

<ASV> For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.

<ASV> Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
<ASV> But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.
<ASV> Now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,
<ASV> Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)

<ASV> And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.
<ASV> And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.
<ASV> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;
<ASV> Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.
<ASV> For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.
<ASV> For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
<ASV> And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?
<ASV> And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
<ASV> And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.
<ASV> And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.

<ASV> And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.
<ASV> And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.

<ASV> And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
<ASV> And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.
<ASV> But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?
<ASV> And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.

<ASV> And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.
<ASV> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.
<ASV> And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.
<ASV> And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.

<ASV> And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.
<ASV> And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,
<ASV> Then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight.
<ASV> But if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord, but rebel against the commandment of the Lord, then shall the hand of the Lord be against you, as it was against your fathers.
<ASV> Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.

<ASV> And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
<ASV> And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.
<ASV> For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
<ASV> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
<ASV> And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
<ASV> And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
<ASV> Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.

<ASV> And the Lord smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.
<ASV> And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
<ASV> See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:
<ASV> Moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the Lord also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
<ASV> And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

<ASV> Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.
<ASV> And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
<ASV> And Saul built an altar unto the Lord: the same was the first altar that he built unto the Lord.

<ASV> Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
<ASV> And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the Lord; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.
<ASV> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
<ASV> And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
<ASV> Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
<ASV> Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.
<ASV> For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.

<ASV> And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
<ASV> And the Lord was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
<ASV> And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes, and by your thousands.

<ASV> Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.
<ASV> And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.
<ASV> Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?

<ASV> What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
<ASV> And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.
<ASV> For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:

<ASV> Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the Lord said, They will deliver thee up.
<ASV> And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the Lord's priests.
<ASV> But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
<ASV> And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the Lord? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.

<ASV> They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.
<ASV> And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.

<ASV> Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
<ASV> And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
<ASV> For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
<ASV> And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
<ASV> For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
<ASV> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.
<ASV> And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
<ASV> Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
<ASV> And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.
<ASV> And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
<ASV> And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:
<ASV> And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.
<ASV> Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
<ASV> And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.
<ASV> But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

<ASV> And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.
<ASV> And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
<ASV> Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
<ASV> Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.
<ASV> And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
<ASV> Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the Lord?
<ASV> And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
<ASV> And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.
<ASV> And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

<ASV> And the children of Israel said unto the Lord, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.
<ASV> And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
<ASV> And the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:
<ASV> And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
<ASV> And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.
<ASV> And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.
<ASV> Therefore Saul said unto the Lord God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.
<ASV> Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
<ASV> But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.
<ASV> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.
<ASV> Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:
<ASV> And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.
<ASV> So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.
<ASV> And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
<ASV> And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.
<ASV> Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.
<ASV> And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the Lord, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
<ASV> And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
<ASV> And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
<ASV> And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.
<ASV> And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
<ASV> And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord;
<ASV> And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
<ASV> Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
<ASV> And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
<ASV> I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the Lord, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.
<ASV> But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the Lord hath sent thee away.
<ASV> Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.
<ASV> Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
<ASV> For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
<ASV> And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
<ASV> For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.
<ASV> Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.
<ASV> Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.
<ASV> By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.
<ASV> And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
<ASV> In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
<ASV> And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
<ASV> Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord: for men abhorred the offering of the Lord.
<ASV> But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.
<ASV> But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
<ASV> For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
<ASV> And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:
<ASV> And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the Lord is your way wherein ye go.
<ASV> I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
<ASV> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;

<ASV> Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.
<ASV> Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;

<ASV> And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.

<ASV> And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.
<ASV> And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)

<ASV> Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the Lord, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.
<ASV> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.

<ASV> Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
<ASV> But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
<ASV> That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:
<ASV> And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.

<ASV> That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
<ASV> And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.
<ASV> And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.

<ASV> And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.

<ASV> Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.

<ASV> And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.
<ASV> And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.

<ASV> That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
<ASV> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.
<ASV> Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
<ASV> And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.

<ASV> Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
<ASV> And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
<ASV> And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
<ASV> Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
<ASV> And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
<ASV> Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.
<ASV> If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.

<ASV> And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.

<ASV> And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.

<ASV> And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
<ASV> David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.
<ASV> Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
<ASV> But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.
<ASV> And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
<ASV> For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
<ASV> And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
<ASV> By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
<ASV> Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
<ASV> For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.

<ASV> And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
<ASV> I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
<ASV> And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.
<ASV> And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.
<ASV> And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:
<ASV> And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
<ASV> And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
<ASV> And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.
<ASV> And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.

<ASV> And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.
<ASV> But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
<ASV> That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.
<ASV> And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child.

<ASV> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.
<ASV> Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.
<ASV> Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:
<ASV> How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
<ASV> And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:
<ASV> And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.
<ASV> Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
<ASV> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:

<ASV> And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
<ASV> And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
<ASV> And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
<ASV> And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.
<ASV> So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.
<ASV> And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
<ASV> And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
<ASV> Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
<ASV> And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
<ASV> And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel.
<ASV> By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
<ASV> And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.
<ASV> Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
<ASV> And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;
<ASV> And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.
<ASV> And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.

<ASV> And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
<ASV> The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.
<ASV> Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the Lord had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the Lord's anointed.
<ASV> And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
<ASV> Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the Lord hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.
<ASV> And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.
<ASV> And the Lord discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
<ASV> And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
<ASV> It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the Lord all night.
<ASV> And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?
<ASV> And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.
<ASV> And they two made a covenant before the Lord: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
<ASV> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the Lord's people to transgress.
<ASV> And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
<ASV> The mountains melted from before the Lord, even that Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel.
<ASV> And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
<ASV> And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
<ASV> And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.
<ASV> Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
<ASV> And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.
<ASV> And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
<ASV> And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.
<ASV> Nevertheless the Lord raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
<ASV> And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
<ASV> Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
<ASV> Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
<ASV> And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
<ASV> But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.
<ASV> Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?
<ASV> To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
<ASV> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
<ASV> And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
<ASV> And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
<ASV> And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
<ASV> When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,
<ASV> Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
<ASV> And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.
<ASV> Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
<ASV> And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
<ASV> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
<ASV> And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
<ASV> And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
<ASV> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
<ASV> We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.
<ASV> Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:
<ASV> And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
<ASV> Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.
<ASV> Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.
<ASV> Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
<ASV> And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,
<ASV> And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
<ASV> And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.
<ASV> Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.
<ASV> And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
<ASV> And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.
<ASV> So he brought down the people unto the water: and the Lord said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.
<ASV> Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.
<ASV> Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
<ASV> And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,
<ASV> Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.
<ASV> But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
<ASV> But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
<ASV> The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.
<ASV> And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
<ASV> Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the Lord have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the Lord; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other gods.
<ASV> And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the Lord delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.
<ASV> And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
<ASV> And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)
<ASV> And he enquired of the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
<ASV> And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;
<ASV> And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
<ASV> But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.
<ASV> So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the Lord, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
<ASV> But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
<ASV> Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
<ASV> But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
<ASV> Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.
<ASV> Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
<ASV> And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
<ASV> And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.
<ASV> Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
<ASV> Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;
<ASV> And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
<ASV> Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.
<ASV> He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.
<ASV> And when Saul enquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
<ASV> And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?
<ASV> And Samuel did that which the Lord spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
<ASV> Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.
<ASV> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
<ASV> And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.
<ASV> If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.
<ASV> And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
<ASV> For in very deed, as the Lord God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites,
<ASV> Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
<ASV> Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
<ASV> And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the Lord, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the Lord.
<ASV> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
<ASV> Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.
<ASV> And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.
<ASV> And he said, What is the thing that the Lord hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.
<ASV> And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,
<ASV> Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.
<ASV> But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
<ASV> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
<ASV> And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the Lord; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.
<ASV> Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
<ASV> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:
<ASV> And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
<ASV> Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;
<ASV> Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.
<ASV> And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
<ASV> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
<ASV> Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
<ASV> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the Lord establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
<ASV> And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
<ASV> And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
<ASV> And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?
<ASV> And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?
<ASV> But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
<ASV> Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
<ASV> And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?
<ASV> And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.
<ASV> And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.
<ASV> And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.
<ASV> For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
<ASV> And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
<ASV> Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
<ASV> And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.
<ASV> And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.
<ASV> And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good.
<ASV> That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
<ASV> And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.
<ASV> And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
<ASV> That the Lord called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.
<ASV> And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord God! for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face.
<ASV> And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.
<ASV> In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
<ASV> And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.
<ASV> But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.
<ASV> And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
<ASV> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:
<ASV> Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.
<ASV> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
<ASV> So now the Lord God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?
<ASV> And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
<ASV> Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
<ASV> And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the Lord; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
<ASV> Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.
<ASV> Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
<ASV> And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.
<ASV> And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
<ASV> But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.
<ASV> For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
<ASV> And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?
<ASV> Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.
<ASV> And the Lord hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:
<ASV> My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the Lord.
<ASV> If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
<ASV> And take the ark of the Lord, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.
<ASV> Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
<ASV> For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
<ASV> But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
<ASV> And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.
<ASV> And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
<ASV> But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
<ASV> For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.
<ASV> And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.
<ASV> The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:
<ASV> And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?
<ASV> And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.
<ASV> And the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
<ASV> Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.
<ASV> And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.
<ASV> Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
<ASV> Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the Lord liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.
<ASV> Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?
<ASV> And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
<ASV> Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;
<ASV> And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:
<ASV> And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
<ASV> And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
<ASV> Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the Lord; I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel.
<ASV> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
<ASV> And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.
<ASV> And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
<ASV> And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
<ASV> But Samuel ministered before the Lord, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
<ASV> And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
<ASV> By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
<ASV> And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.
<ASV> And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.
<ASV> And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
<ASV> But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.
<ASV> But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
<ASV> So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
<ASV> And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?
<ASV> Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
<ASV> And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
<ASV> And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him.
<ASV> Therefore David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
<ASV> And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.
<ASV> And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.
<ASV> And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the Lord hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
<ASV> Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
<ASV> And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.
<ASV> And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
<ASV> So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them.
<ASV> And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.
<ASV> Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.
<ASV> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord.
<ASV> Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.
<ASV> For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.
<ASV> Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
<ASV> Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
<ASV> And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.
<ASV> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.
<ASV> And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart;
<ASV> And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
<ASV> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
<ASV> Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.
<ASV> We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
<ASV> And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.
<ASV> And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.
<ASV> Then Manoah intreated the Lord, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.
<ASV> And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.
<ASV> And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.
<ASV> And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the Lord. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the Lord.
<ASV> And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:
<ASV> Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
<ASV> And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.
<ASV> Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the Lord is with him.
<ASV> And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
<ASV> And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.
<ASV> Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
<ASV> Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.
<ASV> And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the Lord liveth, he shall not be slain.
<ASV> Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.
<ASV> And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
<ASV> And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?
<ASV> For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
<ASV> The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
<ASV> And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.
<ASV> And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the Lord, mine horn is exalted in the Lord: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
<ASV> And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the Lord.
<ASV> And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.
<ASV> For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
<ASV> Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
<ASV> And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
<ASV> And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
<ASV> And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
<ASV> For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.
<ASV> And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the Lord was with them.
<ASV> Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:
<ASV> And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
<ASV> And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.
<ASV> And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
<ASV> For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
<ASV> And it shall come to pass, when the Lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;
<ASV> So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.
<ASV> And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.
<ASV> Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
<ASV> For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.
<ASV> And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
<ASV> And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.
<ASV> That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
<ASV> And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
<ASV> But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
<ASV> The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
<ASV> And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
<ASV> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
<ASV> And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the Lord; but they did not so.
<ASV> And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Lord smote Nabal, that he died.
<ASV> And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
<ASV> Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
<ASV> But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;
<ASV> And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
<ASV> But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
<ASV> And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.
<ASV> And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
<ASV> And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
<ASV> And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
<ASV> But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:
<ASV> And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.
<ASV> And when they forgat the Lord their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
<ASV> Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
<ASV> In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.
<ASV> And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.
<ASV> For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
<ASV> Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
<ASV> Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
<ASV> And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
<ASV> Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
<ASV> Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
<ASV> How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?
<ASV> And he was sore athirst, and called on the Lord, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
<ASV> And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
<ASV> Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
<ASV> And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
<ASV> And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:
<ASV> And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
<ASV> And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.
<ASV> And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:
<ASV> Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.
<ASV> And the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
<ASV> And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the Lord? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.
<ASV> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
<ASV> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
<ASV> And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
<ASV> And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
<ASV> That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
<ASV> And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
<ASV> And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.
<ASV> And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
<ASV> Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
<ASV> And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
<ASV> And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
<ASV> And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.
<ASV> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.
<ASV> Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the Lord only.
<ASV> Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.
<ASV> And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.
<ASV> Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
<ASV> And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?
<ASV> And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
<ASV> And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.
<ASV> Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.
<ASV> But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
<ASV> And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
<ASV> (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:
<ASV> And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
<ASV> And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the Lord; for ye have compassion on me.
<ASV> But his wife said unto him, If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.
<ASV> And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.
<ASV> Therefore they enquired of the Lord further, if the man should yet come thither. And the Lord answered, Behold he hath hid himself among the stuff.
<ASV> And they laid the ark of the Lord upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.
<ASV> When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
<ASV> And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?

<ASV> And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
<ASV> And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.
<ASV> And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
<ASV> And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:
<ASV> When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon.
<ASV> And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
<ASV> The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
<ASV> And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.
<ASV> And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.
<ASV> But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
<ASV> But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

<ASV> And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:

<ASV> And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.
<ASV> Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:

<ASV> And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
<ASV> And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
<ASV> So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
<ASV> And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
<ASV> For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.

<ASV> And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon.
<ASV> And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
<ASV> And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.
<ASV> And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli. And the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision.
<ASV> To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,
<ASV> And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
<ASV> And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
<ASV> For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
<ASV> Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
<ASV> And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the Lord liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
<ASV> And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
<ASV> And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there.
<ASV> And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:
<ASV> He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
<ASV> And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.
<ASV> So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the Lord even require it at the hand of David's enemies.
<ASV> Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.
<ASV> And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
<ASV> Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.
<ASV> The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.

<ASV> Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
<ASV> And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?

<ASV> And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;
<ASV> And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

<ASV> To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.
<ASV> And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
<ASV> And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?

<ASV> And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? but now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

<ASV> And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?

<ASV> After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
<ASV> And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

<ASV> Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the Lord done this thing unto thee this day.
<ASV> For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;

<ASV> If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

<ASV> And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.

<ASV> Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
<ASV> So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

<ASV> For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;

<ASV> And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
<ASV> Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:

<ASV> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
<ASV> So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.
<ASV> That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.
<ASV> And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.
<ASV> Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
<ASV> And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?
<ASV> And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
<ASV> And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.
<ASV> So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
<ASV> And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.

<ASV> And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
<ASV> And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
<ASV> While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?
<ASV> Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,
<ASV> So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
<ASV> Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

<ASV> And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.
<ASV> Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
<ASV> And Jonathan said unto David, O Lord God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;

<ASV> Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
<ASV> Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the Lord. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
<ASV> For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
<ASV> And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.
<ASV> And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
<ASV> And the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
<ASV> And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.
<ASV> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
<ASV> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,
<ASV> God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
<ASV> And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
<ASV> So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
<ASV> And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the Lord's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
<ASV> But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.
<ASV> And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.
<ASV> Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,
<ASV> I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
<ASV> And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
<ASV> And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:
<ASV> And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
<ASV> And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
<ASV> The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
<ASV> For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.
<ASV> And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord.
<ASV> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
<ASV> The Lord forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
<ASV> And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the Lord your God was your king.
<ASV> And the Lord said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
<ASV> And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
<ASV> So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the Lord delivered them into his hands.
<ASV> That the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
<ASV> And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
<ASV> Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.
<ASV> For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.
<ASV> Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
<ASV> Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
<ASV> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
<ASV> And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
<ASV> Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
<ASV> Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.
<ASV> Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
<ASV> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
<ASV> And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
<ASV> Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:
<ASV> Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
<ASV> But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.
<ASV> And Samuel said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.
<ASV> And the Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?
<ASV> And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.
<ASV> And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.
<ASV> And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
<ASV> And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.
<ASV> For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
<ASV> But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.
<ASV> But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
<ASV> She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.
<ASV> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
<ASV> And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
<ASV> For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
<ASV> Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:
<ASV> And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.
<ASV> Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
<ASV> And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
<ASV> But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
<ASV> And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
<ASV> And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?
<ASV> And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord.
<ASV> And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.
<ASV> Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
<ASV> And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
<ASV> And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
<ASV> Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.
<ASV> And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
<ASV> And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
<ASV> Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
<ASV> Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.
<ASV> And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the Lord: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
<ASV> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
<ASV> So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the Lord.
<ASV> And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.
<ASV> And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;
<ASV> And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
<ASV> And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
<ASV> And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
<ASV> (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
<ASV> Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.
<ASV> Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?
<ASV> Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
<ASV> And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;
<ASV> And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord.
<ASV> Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.
<ASV> Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;
<ASV> And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:
<ASV> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
<ASV> They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates.
<ASV> And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
<ASV> Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the Lord.
<ASV> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord.
<ASV> And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.
<ASV> And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
<ASV> Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.
<ASV> But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:
<ASV> So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
<ASV> And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.
<ASV> And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
<ASV> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
<ASV> And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
<ASV> And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:
<ASV> And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.
<ASV> And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.
<ASV> Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
<ASV> But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
<ASV> For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
<ASV> Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
<ASV> And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
<ASV> And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
<ASV> Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
<ASV> Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the Lord in Mizpeh.
<ASV> Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.
<ASV> But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.
<ASV> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
<ASV> And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
<ASV> But the angel of the Lord did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the Lord.
<ASV> But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
<ASV> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
<ASV> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.
<ASV> And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
<ASV> Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
<ASV> And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.
<ASV> And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.
<ASV> And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
<ASV> And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
<ASV> And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
<ASV> Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.
<ASV> And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.
<ASV> And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.
<ASV> But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.
<ASV> And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee king over Israel?
<ASV> Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
<ASV> That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
<ASV> Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.
<ASV> For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
<ASV> Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
<ASV> So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.
<ASV> And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
<ASV> And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)
<ASV> Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him.
<ASV> And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.
<ASV> And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
<ASV> So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
<ASV> And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.
<ASV> So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
<ASV> So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.
<ASV> Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
<ASV> Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.
<ASV> And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.
<ASV> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
<ASV> And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
<ASV> And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.
<ASV> And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.
<ASV> So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
<ASV> But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
<ASV> (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
<ASV> Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
<ASV> For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.
<ASV> And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.
<ASV> Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:
<ASV> For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
<ASV> So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
<ASV> And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
<ASV> And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.
<ASV> For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
<ASV> Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
<ASV> And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;
<ASV> And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
<ASV> And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.
<ASV> For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
<ASV> And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?
<ASV> And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
<ASV> And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
<ASV> Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
<ASV> And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.
<ASV> Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.
<ASV> It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
<ASV> Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
<ASV> Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
<ASV> Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
<ASV> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
<ASV> And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.
<ASV> Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
<ASV> For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
<ASV> And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
<ASV> And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
<ASV> And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
<ASV> And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?
<ASV> And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.
<ASV> And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the Lord; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
<ASV> Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the Lord in Mizpeh.
<ASV> And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
<ASV> And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
<ASV> And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.
<ASV> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
<ASV> But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;

<ASV> And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.

<ASV> And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.

<ASV> And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.

<ASV> And it came to pass, when the angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
<ASV> And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?

<ASV> And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
<ASV> And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

<ASV> So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
<ASV> Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
<ASV> And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
<ASV> The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.

<ASV> And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.
<ASV> And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the Lord: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.
<ASV> Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
<ASV> And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
<ASV> And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.

<ASV> And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.
<ASV> And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
<ASV> Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
<ASV> Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?
<ASV> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the Lord had shut up her womb.

<ASV> David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.
<ASV> And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
<ASV> And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the Lord: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the Lord.
<ASV> And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:
<ASV> And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the Lord from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
<ASV> For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
<ASV> Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
<ASV> But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
<ASV> For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.
<ASV> Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.
<ASV> Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
<ASV> And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.
<ASV> Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the Lord; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.
<ASV> And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.
<ASV> But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
<ASV> For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
<ASV> And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
<ASV> And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.
<ASV> Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
<ASV> Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.
<ASV> For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
<ASV> So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.
<ASV> I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
<ASV> And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.
<ASV> (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:
<ASV> And this will we do, if God permit.
<ASV> And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
<ASV> And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
<ASV> That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
<ASV> Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.
<ASV> But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?
<ASV> And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
<ASV> Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
<ASV> And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.
<ASV> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.
<ASV> So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
<ASV> They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
<ASV> They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
<ASV> Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
<ASV> For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
<ASV> But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
<ASV> And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
<ASV> For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
<ASV> And they cried unto the Lord, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the Lord, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
<ASV> But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
<ASV> And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
<ASV> Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?
<ASV> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.
<ASV> And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
<ASV> And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
<ASV> And when the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
<ASV> And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
<ASV> But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
<ASV> And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
<ASV> And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
<ASV> And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
<ASV> Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
<ASV> But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:
<ASV> Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
<ASV> And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
<ASV> Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.
