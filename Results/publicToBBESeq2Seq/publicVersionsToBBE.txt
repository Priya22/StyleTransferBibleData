And when he had come to the other side of Jordan , he went over him and the three hundred men who were with him .
And he was judged by Israel for twenty-three years . So he came to his end and was put to rest in the earth .
And David got up and came to the place where Saul had put up ; and David saw the place where Saul put up his army and Abner , the son of Ner , the captain of his army : and Saul got up in the market-place and the people put up round him .
In those days there is no king in Israel ; everyone who is right in his eyes .
